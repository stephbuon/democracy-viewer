1045,Mr. President. I rise to offer introductory remarks on the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act. a bill that I am introducing today with my colleagues Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. LEAHY. and Mr. JEFFORDS. Before we adjourned for the summer recess. Congress spent many -weeks preoccupied with weighty fiscal matters like how to divvy up a hypothetical budget surplus. whether to grant tax cuts with money that may or may not exist. or whether to do the responsible thing and pay off the national debt with any surplus that might actually materialize. Make no mistake. these are important issues. but they are not the only issues that should cause us concern. Recent visits with citizens in Connecticut reinforced my conviction that one of the most critical. but commonly overlooked. issues facing our nation today is the conservation debt that we have amassed in recent years. This conservation debt is difficult to define because it cannot be measured in dollars and cents. It is not dependent on interest rates or stock market gyrations. It is not a debt that can be paid off by signing a check when eventually we realize that we have shortchanged our childrens environmental inheritance. This conservation debt grows as urban sprawl spreads across prime farmland and degrades wetlands. It is a debt that multiples every time a community misses a chance to acquire the watershed lands that help to purify their drinking water. It is a debt that grows irreversibly every time another endangered species is driven down the oneway road to extinction. It is a debt that increases each time an untended urban park is ceded to drugpeddlers through neglect and inattention. It is a debt that builds every time a structure representing our cultural heritage is demolished rather than renovated. It is a debt that we can no longer afford to ignore. Unfortunately. too little has been said or done recently in Washington to define the steps weas a nationshould take to pay off the conservation debt and ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a planet that is healthy. productive. and blessed with abundant. clean. green open space. Because I am committed to preserving a rich environmental legacy for our children. today I join with Mr. CHAFEE. from Rhode Island. the esteemed Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee on which I serve. and Mr. LEAHY and Mr. JEFFORDS from Vermont to introduce the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act of 1999. The principle behind our bill is simple: as we deplete federallyowned. nonrenewable natural resources such as oil and gas. we should reinvest the proceeds to establish a reliable source of funding for State. local. and federal efforts to conserve land and water. provide recreational opportunities. preserve historic resources. protect fish and wildlife. and preserve open space. The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act honors this principle by reestablishing Americas longstanding commitment to protecting land. fish and wildlife. and our cultural heritage and by redoubling Federal commitments that help states and localities protect the open space and recreational opportunities that Americans cherish so deeply. Notwithstanding our current conservation debt. America has made many wise conservation investments over the years. Therefore. the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act is not spun entirely from whole cloth. but also improves upon those things we have done well. For example. the Land and Water Conservation Fund. which has served as the primary Federal source of funds for the acquisition of recreational lands since 1965. has been a tremendous success by any measure. It has helped protect more than seven million acres of open space and contributed to the development of 37.000 parks and recreation areas across the country. Everglades and Saguaro National Parks. the Appalachian Trail. the Martin Luther King. Jr.. National Historic Site. and Niagara Falls are few examples of treasured places across the country that have been created or protected with help from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Because the Outer Continental Shelf petroleum royalty system is already in collecting billions of dollars every year. rather than introducing new taxes. this bill would simply ensure that taxes historically raised for conservation purposes actually result in conservation activity. Despite the notable successes and broad bipartisan support and authorization for $900 million dollars. Congress has failed to appropriate sufficient money for Land and Water Conservation Fund. More than $11 billion dollars of authorized conservation funding has been funneled back into the general treasury since the Fund was established. Again. this bill requires no new taxesit simply ensures that existing revenues are spent on the conservation priorities that communities across the country have identified. The stateside portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fundthe money that is supposed to help states and local communities direct their own conservation and recreation goals--has gone completely unfunded since 1995. This is particularly troubling for me because Connecticut has the smallest percentage of federallyowned land of any state in the union. The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act ensures that the Land and Water Conservation Fund will receive full authorized funding every year. The bill also builds on the success of the Fund. by authorizing a new program for State Lands of National or Regional Interest to help protect areas of unique ecological. recreational. aesthetic. or regional value that would not be eligible for traditional Land and Water Conservation Fund support. We also provide full funding for other successful programs with an existing claim on Outer Continental Shelf revenues. including the Historic Preservation Fund. and the. Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program. Every year our bill will reinvest $250 million dollars of Outer Continental Shelf petroleum revenues in State fish and wildlife conservation efforts. with special emphasis on projects that protect nongame and threatened or endangered species. The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act also creates a $900 million Environmental Stewardship Fund to be distributed to States for the purposes of conserving. protecting. and restoring their natural resources beyond what is required by current law. The Environmental Stewardship Fund is designed so that States have the flexibility to devise innovative solutions to their individual conservation challenges. This commitment to helping. but not dictating how. communities achieve their conservation goals is exceptionally important. Over the last year. the State of Connecticut has acquired 3.725 acres of open space worth more that $15 million dollars in 24 different municipalities. These open space purchases represent important steps toward the state goal of setting aside 21% of Connecticut land as open space. However. that goal is still more than 345.000 acres away from being reality. Each state has unique conservation and recreation priorities and the NRRA ensures that they will have flexible federal assistance they need to put their plans into practice. Because the NRRA would support diverse ideas and approaches to conserving and protecting the nations natural and cultural resources. each state will also benefit from the innovation and lessons learned by other states from coast to coast. Finally. the Natural Resources Reinvestment Act clarifies and improves existing laws to leverage opportunities to protect farmland and watersheds. and mitigate the extent to which transportation projects encroach on open and green space. While these improvements are made in federal laws. they affect local decisions. For example. the NRRA amends the 1996 Farm Bill so that state and local conservation organizations can help acquire easements designed to maintain productive farmland as productive farms. This provision of the NRRA gives communities a powerful tool to help make sure that family farms are not squeezed out of American communities as cities and towns grow and prosper in the 21st century. By amending the Federal Water Pollution Control Act so that up to 10% of the State Revolving Loan Fund can be used for matching grants to purchase land that protects watersheds. the NRRA recognizes that flexibility is critical for costeffective delivery of clean and healthy drinking water to American homes and businesses. This provision of the NRRA recognizes that protecting watersheds--the Earths natural water filtration and purification systemsby preserving open space can be an important and relatively inexpensive component of municipal water supply strategies. Americas - worldclass network Of roads and highways represents the foundation of our national commerce.. It also embodies many families tickets to staying in touch with friends and relatives across the country and their passports for exploring the beauty and history of our nation. The NRRA amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century so that highway development funds can be used to purchase open space and green corridors that will help mitigate the effects of transportationrelated growth and development. The Natural Resources Reinvestment Act represents a strong. renewed federal commitment to protecting our natural and historical resources nationwide at local. state. and regional levels. It demonstrates our dedication to ensuring that revenues from oil and gas leasing on federal lands are reinvested in our heritage for current and future generations alike. Mr. President. I ask that the bill be printed in the RECORD. The bill follows: S. 1573 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.,4148,4148_interior_cara_nrra_conservation,"['interior', 'cara', 'nrra', 'conservation', 'forest', 'mop', 'humanities', 'parks', 'wildlife', 'riders']",interior - cara - nrra - conservation - forest - mop - humanities - parks - wildlife - riders,0.967150299,TRUE,1060077070

4221,"Madam Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chairman. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the organization frequently mentioned In. debate here but almost never discussed. the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It celebrates its 224th birthday this year. It is the Nations oldest. largest. and most experienced government organization in the area of water and related land engineering matters. It has provided extraordinary. competent. lifesaving. economic development enhancing service to this country for two and a quarter centuries. Little is it known that the Corps of Engineers. among its many responsibilities. had jurisdiction over Yellowstone Park. The Corps managed Yellowstone for 30 years. And Lieutenant Dan Kingman of the Corps. later to become chief of engineers. wrote: The plan of development which I have submitted Is given upon the supposition and in the earnest hope that it will be preserved as"" nearly as may be as the hand of nature left it. a source of pleasure to all who visit and a source of wealth to no one. A fewer years later. John Muir. founder of the Sierra Club. said: The best service in forest protection. almost the only efficient service. is that rendered by the military. For many years. they have guarded the great Yellowstone Park. and now they are guarding Yosemite. They found It a desert as far as underbrush. grass and flowers are concerned. But. in 2 years. the skin of the mountains is healthy again. blessings on Uncle Sams soldiers. as they have done the job well. and every pine tree is waving its arms for joy. Another great American said: ""The military engineers are taking upon their shoulders the job of making the Mississippi River over. again. a job transcended in size only by the original job of creating it."" That was Mark Twain. Those two statements together pay tribute to what the Corps of Engineers has done so admirably and the great legacy they have left for all Americans protected in floods. enhanced with river navigation programs. and protecting the great resource of the Great Lakes. one fifth of all the fresh water on the face of the Earth. And that is the -spirit in which we normally present the Water Resources Development Act. projects throughout our Nation to promote control of floods. to enhance river navigation. to protect our shores. to protect and restore the environment. to enhance navigation. And that is mostly what this bill before us does today. with one flaw. It fails to give the capital of the worlds sixth largest economy. the City of Sacramento. the flood protection it needs and deserves. This deficiency comes from a dispute between two parts of the State of California that has resulted in flood control at Sacramento being held hostage for almost a decade. The amendment made in order by the selfexecuting rule. and which is now adopted because the rule has been adopted. gives the City of Sacramento only 117 years of flood protection. and that is the estimate of the Corps of Engineers in their 1997 analysis. That is significantly less than the protection given cities of comparable size. the nearly 200 to 500 years protection for Santa Ana. Tacoma. New Orleans. St. Louis. Dallas. Kansas City. Omaha. Surely Sacramento deserves as much flood protection as those cities. Today some 400.000 residents in Sacramento face an unacceptable risk of flood. 160.000 residential structures are in the flood plain in the capital city. 5.000 businesses. 1.200 government facilities. with an estimated value of $37 billion. The 55.000acre flood plain includes seven of the nine major hospitals in the region and 130 schools. Potential losses from flood in the City of Sacramento range from 37 billion to $16 billion depending on the size of the flood. Even at the lower end of the scale. flood losses in Sacramento would be comparable to the losses experienced in the Northridge earthquake a few years ago. to date the single largest disaster in U.S. history. Now. I do not say these words and make those comments in the abstract. I have traveled several times to Sacramento. I have bicycled along the flood protection walls of the American River. I have traveled to Folsom Dam and further up river to the site once planned and once development begun on the Auburn Dam proposal by the Bureau of Reclamation. I understand what is at stake here. Linking flood protection for Sacramento and reallocation of water through a new dam at Auburn has been in the works for many. many years. But the Bureau of Reclamation already stubbed its toe to the tune of $250 million developing the base for a dam right on the fault line of a major earthquake region in the upper reaches of the American River. The Auburn Dam has already been rejected by the House in 1992 in a vote of 273140. And it was rejected in 1996 in our Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in a vote of 28 ayes. 35 nays. There is no reason to believe the vote would be any different today. So why could we not have just simply accommodated whatever water resource needs there may be for the upper reaches of the American River. and at the same time provide Sacramento its requested 200year flood protection. and have done it in this bill? I had an amendment in committee to do that. I offered the amendment in committee to make the adjustments to Folsom. to widen the outlets so the gates can discharge more water. raise the level of the dam to allow more water to be discharged in advance of midwinter melt from the Sierra Nevada Mountains. where they get as much as 30 feet of snow and often have midwinter rains that cause not only runoff but melt. to accommodate that runoff. accommodate in a larger basin and -protect Sacramento and its residents and facilities. and also improve the levees at Sacramento to accommodate that increased runoff. The amendment was defeated on a straight partyline vote. And now we come to the floor with this legislation that does not do what Sacramento truly deserves and. as the gentleman from California said. does not really provide the water resources needs of the upper reaches of the American River Valley area. There were several arguments made about the amendment that I offered. One was that the levee strengthening proposed for Sacramento in my amendment would create unacceptable risks to areas downstream. But that objection fails on closer scrutiny. The Army Corps of Engineers analyzed that argument and rejected it. The Corps specifically stated this: ""Additional protection can be provided without adversely affecting the reaches below the mouth of the American River without project conditions."" The Corps plan includes several different structural and operational modifications to ensure that no flood threat is transferred to downstream interests. In addition. I talked with the City of Sacramento. They have committed to spend $100 million to mitigate any possible further adverse effects downstream. Finally. my. amendment specifically required that measures to increase the capacity of the levees be undertaken only after downstream mitigation features will have been constructed. So absent any objective. substantive reason for opposition to the Sacramento amendment. I am left only to surmise that the real basis for opposition was the desire by upstream interests to withhold flood protection from Sacramento in hope that the Auburn Dam at some future time could be revived or that some alternative. far more expensive yet unstudied water distribution plan be enacted. That is not the way to conduct the water resources business of the country. And while I am not prepared to accept this legislation as it is to go forward with the bill on the floor. the bill before us. I will not relent in my purpose of providing for Sacramento the protection that it rightly deserves and to address in a rational and responsible manner the wate resources requirements upstream of Sacramento in an appropriate time frame. We should not hold Sacramento hostage. We will have to come back at another time to address this issue. And I am confident that at that future time we will treat the lives and the property of the residents of Sacramento in an appropriate and responsible manner. as this committee has always done. absent these extraneous considerations.",849,849_sacramento_commerce_natural_flood,"['sacramento', 'commerce', 'natural', 'flood', 'minute', 'mineral', 'dam', 'resources', 'downstream', 'subcommittee']",sacramento - commerce - natural - flood - minute - mineral - dam - resources - downstream - subcommittee,0.734116434,TRUE,1060025298

25201,"Mr. President. I rise to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964. which was signed into law on September 3. 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. and to announce the formation of a Senate Wilderness and Public Lands Caucus. The Wilderness Act became law seven years after the first wilderness bill was introduced by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. The final bill. sponsored by Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico. passed the Senate by a vote of 7312 on April 9. 1963. and passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 3731 on July 30. 1964. The Wilderness Act of 1964 established a National Wilderness Preservation System ""to secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness."" The law reserves to Congress the authority to designate wilderness areas. and directs the federal land management agencies to review the lands under their responsibility for their wilderness potential. The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest Service land in 54 wilderness areas. Now. after passage of 102 pieces of legislation the wilderness system is comprised of over 104 million acres in 625 wilderness areas. across 44 States. and administered by four federal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. and the Bureau of Land Management. the Fish and Wildlife Service. and the National Park Service in the Department of the Interior. As we in this body know well. the passage and enactment of legislation of this type is a remarkable accomplishment. It requires steady. bipartisan commitment. institutional support. and direct leadership. The United States Senate was instrumental in shaping this very important law. and this anniversary gives us the opportunity to recognize this role. I am honored today to be joined on the floor by one of the three Senators remaining in this body who have the distinguished honor of having voted for this legislation. the Senior Senator from West Virginia . I look forward to his remarks at the conclusion of my own. The Senior Senator from Massachusetts and the Senior Senator from Hawaii . who also voted for this legislation. have asked that their remarks regarding this anniversary be included in the RECORD. Their remarks will also appear .in the RECORD together with my remarks on the Wilderness Act anniversary. In addition. I understand that the Ranking Member of the Energy Committee has a statement on the anniversary. Under the Wilderness Act. wilderness is defined as ""an area of undeveloped -federal land retaining its primeval character and influence which generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature. with the imprint of mans work substantially unnoticeable."" The concept of the creation of a national wilderness system marked an innovation in the American conservation movementwilderness would be a place where our ""management strategy"" would be to leave lands essentially undeveloped. Congress lavished more time and effort on the wilderness bill than almost any other measure in conservation history. The original bill established 9.1 million acres of federally protected wilderness in national forests. From June 1957 until May 1964 there were nine separate hearings on the proposal. collecting over six thousand pages of testimony. The bill itself was modified and rewritten sixtysix different times. Twenty different Senators made statements on the legislation. Much of the delay in reaching a final version stemmed from the conflicts between the scope of the bills restrictions on mining. grazing. oil and other extractive activities on designated wilderness areas and the need for the law to be flexible in the light of preexisting activities. The bills supporters argued that the measure gave legal sanction to the areas already being managed by the Forest Service as primitive areas. More importantly. they successfully argued that Congressional action was necessary because the wilderness that exists is its own finite resource. More than a century of development had brought greatly changed conditions to both public and private lands throughout the country. ""If the year were 1857 instead of 1957."" one supporter of the bill wrote in the Living Wilderness. the Wilderness Societys newsletter. ""Id say definitely no [to a wilderness bill]. But given the almost total dominance of developed civilization. I am compelled to work for saving the remnants of undeveloped land."" I think those remarks apply just as well to the state of our federal lands today. more than thirtyfive years later. My interest in this law stems from the fact that Wisconsin has produced great wilderness thinkers and leaders in the wilderness movement such as Aldo Leopold. Sigurd Olsen. John Muir and former Senator Gaylord Nelson. Senator Nelson was a cosponsor of the Wilderness Act of 1964. along with former Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire. I am proud to now hold the Senate seat that Senator Nelson held with distinction from 1963 to 1981. As a Senator from Wisconsin. I have a special depth of feeling about this issue. The testimony at Congressional hearings and the treatment of the bill in the press of the day reveals Wisconsins crucial role in the long and continuing American debate about our wild places. and the development of the Wilderness Act. The names and ideas of John Muir. Sigurd Olson. and Aldo Leopold. especially Leopold. appear time and tim6 again in the legislative history. Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico. chairman of what was then called the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. stated that his support of the wilderness system was the direct result of discussions he had held almost forty years before with Leopold. who was then in the Southwest with the Forest Service. It was Leopold who advocated. while with the Forest Service. the creation of a primitive area in the Gila National Forest in New Mexico in 1923. The Gila Primitive Area formally became part of the wilderness system when the Wilderness Act became law. In a statement in favor of the Wilderness Act in the New York Times. then Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall discussed ecology and what he called ""a land ethic"" and referred to Leopold as the instigator of the modern wilderness movement. At a Senate hearing in 1961. David Brower of the Sierra Club went so far as to allege that ""no man who reads Leopold with an open mind will ever again. with a clear conscience. be able to step up and testify against the wilderness bill."" For others. the ideas of Olson and Muir provided a justification for the wilderness system. particularly that. the countrys strength depends upon blending contact with the primitive into a civilized existence because the frontier played such a central role in the our history. Passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964 has not terminated the American debate over the meaning. value and need to protect wild country. As I mentioned. the wilderness system has dramatically expanded under both Republican and Democratic leadership. The number of wildernesses established and acres designated by each Congress has varied greatly from year to year. There have been only nine individual years since passage of the Wilderness Act when no wildernesses were designated. and 1965 to 1967 was the only period of three consecutive years in which no wilderness legislation was passed by Congress. In 1984. during the Reagan Administration. 175 wildernesses were established. more than double any other years addition. Despite the record -number of new wildernesses in 1984. the largest number of wilderness acres was designated in 1980 with passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. which added over 56 million acres to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Combined with other wilderness laws passed that year. nearly 61 million acres of wilderness were designated in 1980. more than 6 times the number of acres passed in any other year. Significant additions to the system continued up until 1994. when Congress passed the California Desert Protection Act. Despite this accomplishment. Congress has gotten out of the habit of passing wilderness bills which protect our remaining wildernessquality federal lands. In the 105th Congress. the Senates actions were much more modest--we added about 160 acres to the Eagles Nest Wilderness in Colorado. However. Congress has much bolder bills before.it. with bipartisan support. such as the bills to designate 9.1 million acres in Utah and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as wilderness. In addition. President Clinton proposed a new omnibus National Parks wilderness bill in his State of the Union. We need to address these measures. and to revitalize the tradition of statewide and state delegation led wilderness bills. In order to get the Senate in a position to act on wilderness.issues. I hope to raise awareness of the importance of wilderness in the Senate. I have been working to organize a Wilderness and Public Lands Caucus that will help the Senate to renew its bipartisan commitment to the active protection of wilderness and public lands. Today I am delighted to announce that Senator MCCAIN. Senator DURBIN. Senator FEINSTEIN. Senator MURRAY. and Senator BAYH will be joining me in this effort. I encourage any member of the Senate interested in learning about and working on these issues to join our caucus. and I am grateful to these members who are willing to lend their time and leadership. I feel it is time to promote and redevelop expertise on these issues in the Senate. In the early days of the Wilderness Act many Senators had expertise on these issues. and ad hoc coalitions formed to pass large bills with provisions for a number of states. However. now that the Senate has lost its zeal for the continuing work of identifying and designating wilderness areas this expertise has dwindled. Without a new dedication to rebuilding this expertise. wilderness and public lands issues will remain increasingly divisive. despite a resurgent public interest in our wilderness and an increased public desire for Congress to extend additional protection to federal lands of wilderness quality. I intend for the caucus to meet as necessary during each Senate session in pursttit of several objectives: To assist members in defending existing wilderness areas. and other federal land resources already protected in the public trust. from activities that have the potential to significantly affect the qualities for which they were designated. To support and provide advice to members seeking opportunities to designate new wilderness areas. To provide members with a bipartisan forum in which to discuss wilderness and other public land protection and management issues and learn from others expertise. To educate members about the Wilderness Act and other federal land management statutes. and to improve understanding of the appropriate uses of various federal land management designations and the federal financial and management requirements needed to implement them. Mr. President. many would agree that more must be done to protect our wild places. One of the things that needs to be done. particularly on the cusp of the Millennium. is to examine and improve the ability of this body to understand and grappl e with these issues in the public interest. This is a great institution. with a strong conservation history. which has produced the Wilderness Act. one of the gems of conservation law. I am actively committing to working on wilderness issues because I believe it to be in the Wisconsin tradition. and. as a Senator. I am trying to use the tools I have been given by the people of Wisconsin to build the leadership needed to defend these places. In conclusion. I would like to remind colleagues of the words of Aldo Leopold in his 1949 book. A Sand County Almanac. He said. ""The outstanding scientific discovery of the Twentieth Century is not the television. or radio. but rather the complexity of the land organism. Only those who knowthe most about it can appreciate how little is known about it."" We still have much to learn. but this anniversary of the Wilderness Act reminds us how far we have come and how powerful a collegial commitment to public lands can be in the Senate. I am very pleased and honored to be able to yield the remainder of my time .to one of the three Senators who is here to vote for this legislation. the senior Senator from West Virginia.

27152,Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Chemical Security Act of 1999. a bill which will address the threat of criminal attack on chemical facilities. The FBI and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have warned us that the possibility of terrorist and criminal attacks on chemical plants is a serious threat to public safety. The scenarios they describe are truly chilling. The concerns about criminal attack on chemical plants were initially raised in the context of Internet access to chemical accident information. Some were concerned that criminals could use chemical accident information. gained through the Internet. to target their attacks. In response. we will soon send a bill to the President that will balance the benefits of public access to chemical accident information against the threat of criminal attack. However. Mr. President. the underlying issue is not Internet access to such - informationno resourceful criminal needs the Internet to find a chemical plant to attack. A chemical plant target can be found by driving through neighborhood. reading a city map. or accessing information already available from government and business sources. The real issue is the vulnerability of chemical facilities to attacka vulnerability which can arise from a lack of adequate security at chemical facilities. as well as the use of inherently hazardous chemical operations. even when safer technologies are available. The Chemical Security Act of 1999 will directly address the potential danger of criminal attack on chemical facilities. First. the Act will clarify that it is the general duty of chemical facilities under the Clean Air Act to reduce their own vulnerability to criminal attack. Second. it will require the Attorney General. within one year. to determine whether chemical facilities are taking adequate measures to reduce their vulnerability to criminal attacks that could cause substantial. harm to public health. safety. and environment. Third. if the Attorney General finds that chemical facilities are not taking such actions. the Act will require the Attorney General. in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency. within two years. to promulgate regulations requiring appropriate measures to detect. prevent. and minimize the consequences of such criminal attack. Mr. President. the American public has the right to chemical facilities that are safe from criminal attack. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.*,2855,2855_chemical_facilities_plants_chemicals,"['chemical', 'facilities', 'plants', 'chemicals', 'cfats', '4007', 'vulnerability', 'dhs', 'plant', 'vulnerabilities']",chemical - facilities - plants - chemicals - cfats - 4007 - vulnerability - dhs - plant - vulnerabilities,0.94136402,TRUE,1060070460

64423,"These organizations represent labor. agriculture. port facilities. flood control districts. and others. They are located -in areas as distant as the States of Washington. Louisiana. Minnesota. and Pennsylvania. Since this letter was signed. additional groups have asked to join with us in our position- in support of section 103. They include the Minnesota 6ssociation of Cooperatives. the St. Louis Building and Construction Trades Council. the Minnesota Farm Bureau. the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association. and the Minnesota Corn Growers Association. In Missouri. our Department of Natural Resources supports section 103. They oppose raising the spring river height. and they are just as knowledgeable and just as dedicated as the socalled experts at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who want to jump over the process and impose their particular risky scheme on our State and all the downstream States. I had a very enlightering week traveling from the northwest corner of my State. down the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers. talking with real people. knowledgeable people. scientists. and experts about this proposal. I was joined and supported by members of the Governors staff. I was joined by the director of our department of natural resources. I was joined by farmers and mayors and chambers of commerce officials. economists and flood control advocates. and other members of our resource agencies. I was joined by representatives of our independent department of conservationone of the finest departments of conservation in the Nation. one that is looked to as a model. and one that is engaged in ongoing work to preserve the pallid sturgeon and to work with us on reasonable. common sense. scientifically proven ways to assure that we keep the pallid sturgeon. From all of these people I heard firsthand how dangerous the Fish and Wildlife Service plan is and how unnecessary it is. I heard from people who ship the goods on the river now and from people"" who want to ship on the river in the future but who are withholding investment in river facilities until the uncertainty of the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal is resolved. I have heard from mayors who are worried about the flood risk in the spring. Unless you have been in one of those communities or one of our large cities where a flood has hit. you do not appreciate how devastating a flood is. I have heard from power companies worried about not having adequate water for cooling in the summer. I have heard from farmers who have been flooded and know firsthand that more water in the spring. despite suggestions to the contrary. means more risk of flood. The farmers who live along the river know that even if it doesnt flood. a higher river level in the spring means more seepage under the levees and wetter fields that you cannot plow and you cannot plant. We are here tonight discussing section 103 because despite the views of the Corps of Engineers. the U.S. Geological Survey. the downstream States. the agricultural groups. and the waterway users. the Fish and Wildlife Service is determined to have it their way or no way. The Fish and Wildlife Service wants to experiment with spring flooding. They must think we have forgotten about the controlled burn in Los Alamos. They want to give us controlled floods on the Missouri River in the spring. I say no thanks. we have been there. we have done it. and we dont need the Federal Government making floods worse. This is not a new proposal. It was raised by the Corps of Engineers in 1993. and after public hearings in Omaha. Kansas City. St. Louis. Quincy. Memphis. New Orleans. and elsewhere. the administration went back to the drawing room to find a consensus with the States. Apparently. the Fish avid Wildlife Service is not interested in a consensus or we would not be here today. They are not interested in the dangers of increased flood risk or we would not be here today. They are not interested in the public meetings and the viewpoints that were expressed in 1995 or this would have ended then. They want to raise the height of the river in the spring because they think flooding may improve the breeding habitat for the pallid sturgeon. The distinguished minority leader says we ought to be able to act on the best information available. I have asked these people: Where is the information? When I talked with them last week. our resource agencies. the U.S. Geological Survey had not seen any biological opinion. They issued that diktat. that letter of instruction. on July 12. As of last week. the State agencies. the U.S. Geological Survey. with expertise in environmental assessment. a fellow Federal agency. had not seen it. How can we let them go ahead with the scheme when they wont even allow us to look at the basis for their proposal? This truly is a risky scheme. This is one that we cannot tolerate. Our State Department of Natural Resources disagrees with Fish and Wildlife. Our State Conservation Department believes the Fish and Wildlife plan is not necessary. They have presented a plan that does not have spring flooding and no transportation flows in the springin the summer and fall. And they believe that plan will do more to help preserve the pallid sturgeon. the least tern. and the piping plover. than this risky scheme put forward by Fish and Wildlife. Our State Conservation Department has an alternative species recovery plan. They cannot get Fish and Wildlife to look at it. Dont you think they would want to look at the various options? Dont you think they would want to consider the evidence before they threaten property and lives with spring floods in Missouri? I have a lot of respect for the difficult and important job of Fish and Wildlife. but let me say this is not about who cares the most about endangered species. The commitment of our Natural Resources Department and our Conservation Department to fish and wildlife is not inferior to that of Fish and Wildlife of the U.S. Government. U.S. Fish and Wildlife does not have a monopoly on dedication and they do not have a monopoly on wisdom. In fact. our Department of Natural Resources has some serious concerns the Fish and Wildlife Service plan may actually harm endangered species rather than help them recover. That fear was expressed by our Governor of Missouri. Governor Carnahan. a Democrat. in a letter to the President 2 weeks ago. Why? Because normally in the summer the natural hydrograph is for the snowmelt to bring the river up. Under this plan. river levels will be going down. That means less water cover. It means burying sandbars where predators might come after the smallest hatch. Fish and Wildlife has a twofold plan. One. it proposes a split season which will end river transportation on the Missouri and do great harm to the river transportation on the Mississippi River. Without water transportation. we are left with a regional railroad monopoly. The minority leader said we initially projected there would be 12 million tons on the river. That is not true. If you look at the 1952 report and the testimony in 1952 and 1956 when they were developing the Missouri River plan. they said 5 million tons. This past year. it was 8 million tons on the river. As I said earlier. there would be a lot more because there is investment out there waiting to happen if we know that Fish and Wildlife is not going to take over the river and get rid of all barge traffic. Barge traffic is the most environmentally sound means of transporting grain to the world markets. It is the most efficient. One barge. one tow with 25 barges. carries the same amount of grain as 870 individual semitrailer trucks that put out far more pollution. Barge transportation bringing inputs to farmers up the river is much more efficient than rail or truck. That lowers the price farmers pay for goods brought in in the spring for Missouri farmers. It lowers them for South Dakota farmers too. the landed price at Sioux City has an impact on what farmers pay. If you got rid of river transportation altogetherwhich I think may be the ultimate goal. I dont think the Fish and Wildlife Service and the people supporting this just want to flood out the people downstream in the spring. I think there is a greater objectivegetting rid of barge transportation altogether. One can only assume that the railroad industry thinks that having no competition is a good idea. But I seriously question whether we. as Senators. should be supporting consolidation rather than competition. The low summer flow proposed by Fish and Wildlife is curious for two additional reasons: One. because it will reduce energy revenues by more than onethird at the dams generating hydropower. particularly during high usage months in the summer. We are about to debate the necessity of a national energy commission to look at how we can meet our growing energy needs. and here we are with a Fish and Wildlife plan to decrease clean hydropower generation. We do not have the luxury of letting existing power capacity go to waste. The low summer flow proposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service reduces revenues in the high demand summer months by more than onethird. Another reason the low flow is curious is that. while the Fish and Wildlife Service said they want the river to ""mimic its natural hydrograph."" historically the highest flows were following the summer snowmelt upstream. and that is the. same time Fish and Wildlife demands a low flow. They go the opposite way of their stated objective. This risky scheme has not been subject to adequate analysis and comment by scientists. by people who understand. who live along. work with. and study the river. That is why we say it should not be implemented in the coming year. Let the studies. the debates go on. We would like to see sound science. We would like to see the best information available. Fish and Wildlife has not shown it to us. The fall harvest is approaching. It looks like bumper crops. We have short supplies of storage. As a matter of fact. -many elevators. grain elevators. started calling my office saying they do not have rail capacity. The railroads cannot get them the cars they need to carry out the fall harvest. and they are going to have to stop taking in grain that comes in. Two years ago. because of railcar shortages and disorganization. grain was piled up on the ground as it was in the former Soviet Union. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes a complete reliance on that one mode of transportation. Last night on the floor. Senator REID spoke candidly about the value of our Nations inland waterway system and noted that: To move this additional cargo by alternative means would require an additional 17.6 million trucks on our Nations highway system or an additional 5.8 million railcars on the nations rail system. To say what can be handled by our inland water system can be moved by rail or trucks. it simply cant be done. I agree with Senator REID. He is quite right. Fish and Wildlife seeks to eliminate water transportation on the Missouri. But Fish and Wildlife has really thought this through because they have a solution for eliminating the transportation options. They are going to propose. through this plan. to curtail agriculture production by flooding farmers in the spring with high water. As I said earlier. raising the river levels in the spring keeps farmers out of the field. So. as a result of the Fish and Wildlife spring rise. there will be less agricultural production awaiting the transportation that is not available. Doesnt that just gladden your hearts? I mean. the farmers who depend for their living upon raising crops and shipping them economically into the world marketguess what. you are not going to have the transportation. But we will take care of that because we will keep you from having the production. That is why the farmers of Missouri say. ""No thanks."" Let me speak to a couple of assertions that do not paint a very full picture of the importance of the debate. First. there is the assumption by some that the Missouri River ends suddenly and does not impact the Mississippi River. That is convenient. but it is not true. I have seen the confluence with my own eyes. I know that in lowwater years. drought years. dry summers. 65 percent of the flow of the Mississippi River at St. Louis comes from the Missouri River. And to say that the Mississippi barge traffic would love to have that water cut back is absolutely ludicrous. That is why the southern Governors. noting the importance of the Missouri River flow in the Mississippi. have sent a resolution in support of section 103 that the minority leader seeks to strike. Second. there is this notionwe heard it expressed earlierthe Corps will never release -extra water in the spring if there is a risk of flooding. Good intention. of course. Give them full credit for trying. But they could only carry out this intention if they could predict the weather perfectly because water released from the South Dakota dam takes 11 days to arrive in St. Louis. A lot of weather can happen in 11 days. Have any of you watched the weather forecasts for the Midwest this summer? I try to keep some trees alive. I watch it. I turn on the weather channel in the morning. It is a lot more informative than some of the morning talk shows. My Farmers Almanac said we were going to have heavy rains in midJune and the end of June. The week before. 5 days before the middle of Junethe middle of July. they said this is a drought season. there is not going to be a drop of water. it is going to be a dry year. The heavens opened up. and we had 5-. 6-. 8inch rains. A lot of weather can occur in even 3 days. I have a lot of respect for my friend from South Dakotapblitical miracles we see him performbut I dont trust him or the Fish and Wildlife Service to predict the weather 11 days in advance downstream. One mistake is all it takes to result in a Governmentimposed flood that brings to mind the controlled burn in Los Alamos. That was not supposed to happen. either. The water is not retrievable when it is released. Rainfall in the lower basin will swell the river after the release. and water from the release will only supplement the flood damage. If the water is at your Adams apple. the Federal Government will do you the courtesy of raising it to -your temple. Third. there is already a spring rise as I have stated. If a spring rise is what is needed to recover the species. we ought to have sturgeon all over the place because we had bodacious floods in 1993 and 1995. Those little sturgeons should be popping up all over because we had a spring rise to end all spring rises. It did not happen. Fourth. with respect to water transportation benefits. the Fish and WildlifeService and my colleague from South Dakota assume that in the absence of competition. the railroad industry will not raise rates on farmers. Try that out on any shipper. Ask anybody in the Midwest who has been captive of the railroad if they really believe that competition does not make any difference. That is the assumption which underlies the small $7 million in benefits from river transportation cited by the opponents of this transportation. If it sounds as if I am picking on the railroad industry. which would be the biggest beneficiaries. along with farmers and producers in Latin America and Australia and Europe. I am not. I have no quarrel with the railroads aiming to maximize their profits. You cannot blame a compass for pointing north. They need to maximize profits. If the Government wants to eliminate their competition. why would they interfere? Every Senator knows. or should know if they studied economics. that in the absence of competition. prices will rise. We see prices rise at the end of the navigation season. On the Mississippi. we see prices rise when locks are closed for maintenance. There is a Fortune 100 firm on the Mississippi River that has built a river terminal it has never used except when it negotiates with the railroads. It has that river terminal. and the railroads come in and say: We are going to charge you x amount for bringing your product in. And they say: We will just open up this river terminal. and we will beat your prices down. They come around. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority which did a study on the Missouri River. the savings to rail shippers because of competition created by barge traffic is an estimated $200 million annually. That is the benefit to shippers. Those people get goods coming in and those shipping commodities out. That includes benefits worth $56 million to shippers in Missouri. $43 million to shippers in Iowa. $36 million to shippers in Nebraska. and as the occupant of the Chair will be interested to know. $52 million to shippers in Kansas. and $14 million to shippers in South Dakota. In summary. flood control is important. energy production is important. and having modern and competitive transportation options for our farmers and shippers is important. With respect to the species. our resource agencies say the Fish and Wildlife Service is wrong and their plan is harmful and unnecessary. That is why I included the provision for the fifth year. This provision does not stop the process as has been alleged by my colleague. It simply says the water management manual cannot be changed to force a dangerous spring rise. It is a risky scheme on which we cannot afford to gamble. It is a controlled flood that is not controllable. Ten years ago. the courts decided to review the river management. Seven years ago. it proposed a spring rise. It was opposed in public hearings from Sioux City to Memphis to New Orleans. It was opposed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It was opposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. It was opposed by agriculture and other shippers. Twentyseven Senators in a bipartisan letter to the President opposed it. So in 1995. the administration rejected the spring rise and went back to the drawing board. The President ordered the Corps to work with the States to find a consensus. Meanwhile. Congress included. section 103 four different times to remind the Fish and Wildlife Service that their obsession to increase flooding was not acceptable. Last year. seven out of eight States arrived at a consensus that the Corps accepted which did not include a spring rise. Then. notwithstanding the public hearings in 1994. the letter to the President. the legislative provisions. notwithstanding the consensus. the Fish and Wildlife Service arrogantly pushes the same old plan to raise the river height in the spring. The U.S. Geological Survey told me last week that they do not know enough about the river or the pallid sturgeon to know if there is any chance the Fish and Wildlife Services plan will work. They are the ones who work to define habitat and biological response. They have not been shown the information from the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Missouri department of conservation says they have an alternative to recover species which does not do premeditated damage to safety. to property. and to human lives. The Missouri department of natural resources said the Fish and Wildlife Services plan is flawed and unnecessary. The provision permits any experiment the Fish and Wildlife Service can dream up except the one risky scheme of a controlled flood in the spring which we cannot tolerate. Members of Congress have every right to place commonsense parameters on bureaucratic excursions. That is the purpose of this provision. We know there are many other benefits that come from wise management of the Missouri River. The spring rise does not help the upstream States. In fact. States such as the Dakotas and Montana will find that they will not have the water they want for recreational purposes if it is flushed down the river in the spring. I know the Fish and Wildlife Service wants to run this river. just as it wants to take over management of a lot of other rivers. but the rivers are authorized for multiple uses. That is the way the Corps and the States manage them. Because the proposal to initiate floods is harmful. because there are alternatives. I believe section 103 is a prudent and restrained safeguard that should be retained in this legislation. and I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to strike.",672,672_river_dams_dam_missouri,"['river', 'dams', 'dam', 'missouri', 'downstream', 'fish', 'flood', 'spring', 'barge', 'wildlife']",river - dams - dam - missouri - downstream - fish - flood - spring - barge - wildlife,1,TRUE,1060179892

72072,Mr. Chairman. I must rise in vigorous opposition to the attempt of the gentleman from Washington to cut one leg off a twolegged bill. because a 50 percent reduction in this acquisition. I think. cuts against three very important principles. One. I would allude to some basic American values that are inscribed in the bar of the House. And if my colleagues have never come down to take a look at them. they ought to sometime. Starting on the left. those basic American values are peace. liberty. tolerance. and justice. And the one we are talking about tonight is union. Because in a very rare display of bipartisanship. we have crafted a union of people across party lines and ideological lines that is embodied in this bill. Mr. Chairman. this amendment will dismember that union that has been so carefully built and vigorously built under the leadership of the gentleman from Alaska and the gentleman from California . the ranking minority member. We ought to stay with this bill as it is. It is a union and it ought to pass. The second rule that is being violated by this amendment is one of physics. the rule pavement does not wait. Concrete does not wait. It does not wait for Congress. It will not wait if we cut 50 percent out of the acquisition funds of this land. That land will be gone. Ask what would have happened in the days when Yellowstone was considered by this Chamber if this Chamber missed the opportunity to save Yellowstone National Park from the Coney Islands that would have been built up along the geysers if we decided not to make that acquisition because. in some way. the Committee on Appropriations had not previously appropriated enough for maintenance somewhere. Imagine if we missed that opportunity. Pavement and concrete do not wait. Third. I just want to say that we talk a lot about the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone Park. but I want to suggest those are the grand jewels of this country. But there are little jewels in every district in this country that need acquisition today. I went to the Grand Canyon last week. I took Friday off. Do not tell anybody. I went down to the Grand Canyon. The first time. I have been there. Mr. Chairman. Teddy Roosevelt was right. He said every American should go to the Grand Canyon before they die. But there is a little place in my district on Bear Creek where the water pools underneath the cedar trees and the salmon used to spawn that if this amendment passes. the salmon will never spawn again because we will not preserve that little tiny piece of the Creators handiwork. and that little jewel of this country. which will never be a Grand Canyon and may be known only to my neighbors will be gone. Let us act tonight for union. let us beat the pavement and let us protect all the little jewels that deserve protection in this country.,6154,6154_1646_kyoto_natcher_ses,"['1646', 'kyoto', 'natcher', 'ses', 'agile', 'pavement', 'canyon', 'gentleladys', 'jewels', 'bombers']",1646 - kyoto - natcher - ses - agile - pavement - canyon - gentleladys - jewels - bombers,1,TRUE,1060139605

73638,"Mr. Chairman. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman PACKARD and the Ranking Member. Mr. VISCLOSKY. and the Members of the Committee. for their support of Sacramento flood control projects included in the FY 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. Flooding remains the single greatest threat to the public safety of the Sacramento community. posing a constant risk to the lives of my constituents and to the regional economy. Thanks to your efforts and the efforts of this Committee. Sacramento can continue to work toward improved flood protection. With a mere 85year level of protection. Sacramento remains the metropolitan area in this nation most at risk to flooding. More than 400.000 people and $37 billion in property reside within the Sacramento flood plain. posing catastrophic consequences in the event of a flood. While Congress will continue to consider the best longterm solution to this threat. funding in this bill will provide much needed improvements to the existing flood control facilities throughout the region. Specifically. this legislation will allow for the continuation of levee improvements and bank stabilization projects along the lower American and Sacramento Rivers. increasing levee reliability and stemming bank erosion. Additionally. I greatly appreciate the Committees willingness to provide funding for projectsincluding the Strong Ranch and Chicken Ranch Sloughs. and Magpie Creekaimed at preventing flooding from a series of smaller rivers and streams that present substantial threats separate from those posed by the major rivers in the region. Importantly. the Committees willingness to include funding for the American River Comprehensive Plan will allow for ongoing Corps of Engineers general investigation work on all area flood control needs. including a permanent longterm solution. - As this legislation moves to a House and Senate conference committee. I also would like to ask conferees to support two ""new start"" projects of critical importance to tlie longterm safety of the Sacramento region that were included in the 1999 Water Resources Development Act. The first would make modifications to the outlet works on Folsom Dam. improving its flood control efficiency. The second would begin construction on the South Sacramento Streams. which will provide a 500year level of protection for a portion of south Sacramento that has long been vulnerable to rising flood waters.",3184,3184_sacramento_flood_levee_levees,"['sacramento', 'flood', 'levee', 'levees', 'flooding', 'natomas', 'dam', 'hmgp', 'engineers', 'folsom']",sacramento - flood - levee - levees - flooding - natomas - dam - hmgp - engineers - folsom,0.880939587,TRUE,1060162326

79911,Madam President. I am pleased that the Senate is poised to pass the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA). This legislation includes critical -provisions to restore the Florida Everglades and the Missouri River in South Dakota and I am hopeful that it will be enacted this year. Among the provisions of WRDA that will most benefit South Dakota is a section incorporating elements of S. 2291. the Missouri River Restoration Act. I introduced this legislation last May to address the siltation of the Missouri River in South Dakota and the threat to Indian cultural and historic sites that border the river. The WRDA bill under consideration today takes an important first step to address these problems. and I want to thank all of my colleagues for their help to secure the passage of this legislation. In particular. Senator JOHNSON. Senator BAUCUS. Senator SMITH of New Hampshire and Senator VOINOVICH deserve praise for their efforts to incorporate this legislation into the larger bill. It is my hope that Congress will adopt the remaining elements of my comprehensive proposal to restore the Missouri River. including the creation of a Missouri River Trust Fund. in the foreseeable future. The need for this legislation stems from the construction of a series of federal dams along the Missouri River in the 1950s and 1960s that forever changed its flow. For decades. these dams have provided affordable electricity for millions of Americans and prevented billions of dollars of damage to downstream states by preventing flooding. They have also created an economically important recreation industry in South Dakota. However. one of the consequences of the dams is that they have virtually eliminated the ability of the Missouri River to carry sediment downstream. Before the dams. the Missouri was known as the Big Muddy because of the heavy sediment load it carried. Today. that sediment is deposited on the river bottom in South Dakota. and significant buildups have occurred where tributaries like the Bad River. White River and Niobrara River empty into the Missouri. The Bad River. for example. deposits millions of tons of silt into the Missouri River each year. This sediment builds up near the cities of Pierre and Ft. Pierre. where it has raised the local water table and flooded area homes. Already. Congress has had to authorize a. $35 million project to relocate hundreds of families. To prevent more serious flooding. the Corps has had to lower releases from the Oahe dam. causing a $12 million annual loss due to restricted power generation. Farther south. near the city of Springfield. sediment from the Niobrara River clogs the Missouris channel for miles. Boats that used to sail from Yankton to Springfield can no longer navigate the channel. eroding the areas economy. This problem will only grow worse. According to the Corps of Engineers. in less than 75 years Lewis and Clark lake will fill entirely with sediment. ending the ability of that reservoir to provide flood control and seriously threatening the economies of cities like Yankton and Vermillion. In addition to the impact of sediment on flood control. over 3000 cultural and historic sites important to Indian tribes. including burial grounds. campsites. and ancient villages. are found along the Missouri River in the Dakotas. Many of these sites are threatened by erosion. and each year some of them are irretrievably lost as they tumble into the river. Critical points of the Lewis and Clark trail also follow the Missouri through South Dakota. and they are threatened by erosion as well. The elements of the Missouri River Restoration Act included in WRDA today address these problems by establishing a Missouri River Task Force composed of federal officials. representatives of the State of South Dakota and area Indian tribes. It will be responsible for developing and implementing a Missouri River Restoration Program to reduce sedimentation and protect cultural and historic sites along the river. I would like to take a few minutes to explain in detail how this process will work First. the bill establishes a 25member Missouri River Trust. Appointments will be made to the Trust by the Secretary of the Army. These appointments must be in accordance with the recommendations of the Governor of South Dakota and area Indian tribes to ensure that there is a strong local voice on the Trust. Second. the bill establishes a Missouri River Task Force. chaired by the Secretary of the Army and including representatives of the Department of Interior. Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. It also includes the Missouri River Trust. Once funding for this legislation becomes available. the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will prepare an assessment of the Missouri River watershed in South Dakota that reviews the impact of siltation on the river. including its impact on a variety of issues: the Federal. State and regional economies. recreation. hydropower. fish and wildlife. and flood control. Based upon this assessment and other pertinent information. the Task Force will develop a plan to improve conservation in the Missouri River watershed. control and remove sediment from the Missouri River. protect recreation on the Missouri from sedimentation. protect Indian and nonIndian cultural and historic sites from erosion. and improve erosion control along the river. Once this plan is approved by the Task Force. the Task Force will review proposals from local. state. federal and other entities to meet the goals of the plan and recommend to the Secretary of the Army which of these proposals to carry out. It is the intention of this legislation that the Corps contract with. or provide grants to. other agencies and local entities to carry out these projects. To the extent possible. the Secretary should ensure that approximately 30 percent of the funds used to carry out these projects are spent on projects within Indian reservations or administered by Indian tribes. The bill authorizes a total of $4 million per year for the next 10 years to carry out these goals. While the Task Force will have the flexibility it needs to take appropriate actions to restore the Missouri River. it is my expectation that a significant effort will be made to improve conservation in the Missouri River watershed. Pilot projects have shown already that the amount of sediment flowing into the Missouris tributaries can be reduced by as much as 50 percent with appropriate conservation practices. If requested. the Task Force will also have the authority to work with farmers across the river in Nebraska. for example. to reduce the amount of sediment flowing in from the Niobrara River. The conceptual underpinnings of this legislation were developed through numerous public discussions that I have held. in South Dakota over the last year. Last January. I held a Missouri River Summit in the town of Springfield with Governor Janklow. Lower Brule Sioux Tribe Chairman Mike Jandreau. and other experts to discuss how to address these critical problems. In April. Governor Janklow and I held a hearing in Pierre to gather public comment about proposals to restore the river. I have been pleased by the outpouring of support I have seen for efforts to restore the river. Dozens of communities such as Yankton. Chamberlain. Springfield. Wagner. Pickstown. Mitchell and others have passed resolutions in support river restoration. American Rivers. a national leader in river protection. has recognized this need as well. The legislation passed today takes the first important step we need to take to get this job done. Id like to thank all those in South Dakota who contributed to this process. and my colleagues in the Senate for all of their support. I look forward to our continued work together. Finally. the WRDA bill includes an amendment to the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. and State of South Dakota Terrestrial Wildlife Habitat Restoration Act. This amendment requires the Corps of Engineers to meet its legal responsibilities to identify and stabilize Indian cultural sites. clean up open dumps. and mitigate wildlife habitat along the river. It also makes important technical changes to that law that will help ensure its smooth implementation. It is my hope that the Corps of Engineers will respond by working closely with the tribes and the state to clean up those lands. stabilize Indian cultural sites. and transfer the lands along the river to the tribes and state in a timely manner. .,672,672_river_dams_dam_missouri,"['river', 'dams', 'dam', 'missouri', 'downstream', 'fish', 'flood', 'spring', 'barge', 'wildlife']",river - dams - dam - missouri - downstream - fish - flood - spring - barge - wildlife,1,TRUE,1060187305

82360,"Mr. President. I rise today to talk about a matter that has impacted every inhabitant of the state of Montana: The wildfires of the past 2 months. The recent rain and snow have finally brought the fires in Montana under control. but many of the largest fires are still smoldering. The Helena Independent Record Recently described the summer of 2000 as a: Fire season marked by miracles and loss. heroism and heartache. smoky skies and blackened backyards. of evacuations. waiting. planning and prayer. . This photo showing two elk trying to escape the flames was taken on August 6th in the Bitterroot Valley by Forest Service firefighter John McColgan. On this particular day several forest fires converged near Sula. burning over 100.000 acres and destroying 10 homes. And this fire was just one of dozens burning across Montana. Mr. President. it is not an exaggeration to say that these fires impacted every inhabitant of Montana. Even people in our cities. miles from the front lines. lived with a constant reminder of the conflagration burning about them.As you can see in this photo of Helena. cities all across the region spent - weeks under a cloud of smoke. Clearly. it was one of the worst fire seasons weve seen in the last 100 years. This is our cathedral. Saint Helenas Cathedral. You can see big smoke columns rising. The fact is. this is dramatically an understatement. I have asked my office to see if there are other photos which more accurately describe the situation in my State. and this is all we could come up with at the time. But this town. Helena. I might say. was so covered with smoke that my houseup just about 500. 600 feet from hereas I was looking across the back alley through the kitchen window. I could not even see across the alley. The whole city was just covered all the way down to ground level with smoke. That was the rule. That was the rule for all Montana cities. with the exception maybe of some of the eastern Montana cities. Most of them had just dense smoke impact for a long time. Clearly one of the worst fire seasons we have seen in over 100 years. But. Mr. President. I didnt cometo. the floor to talk about how bad the fires werethats already apparent. Nor did I come down here to talk about forest management policy and what we could have done to lessen the harmful impact of these firesthere will be plenty of time to address both topics in the weeks and months to come. Mr. President. I am here today to commend the efforts of the thousands of people who pulled together to do battle with one of Mother Natures most unforgiving forces.From New Zealands finest. most experienced firefighters to the Montana volunteers who ranRed Cross evacuee camps. the fires brought together some of the most courageous and hardworking individuals I have ever encountered. Someone once told me that the true character of any community will reveal itself in the face of a natural disaster. I am proud of how Montanans and all of those who came to help rose to this challenge and persevered. Of all the statistics--almost a million acres burned. over 300 structures lost. over $200 million spent in battling firesthe one statistic I am most proud of is the number of human casualtieszero. Thats right. in Montana not one life was lost during this disaster and no one was seriously injured. I cant tell -you how proud I am that safety remained the highest priority: of all of the firefighters who were in harms way. the pilots who flew risky missions dumping water or retardant chemicals over the fiery landscape. and the thousands of people who were evacuatedno one was seriously injured. To me. thats one heck of a statistic. Thats why today. Mr. President. I want to extend a heartfelt ""thank you."" and I know I speak for. every Montanan. I want to thank firefighters from across the country. and around the world. Volunteer firefighters who left their regular jobs. The employees who let them go. Students who postponed attending classes. The families left at home and the coworkers who put in overtime to cover for those who traveled to the west. I might say in this photo. in the center is James Lee Witt. flanked by two members of the Montana delegation. myself on the left. and Senator BURNS on the right. We are talking to a volunteer firefighter. These are people who. when the fire comes. often are in an area next to a communitythere are homes back in the woods and the volunteer fighters immediately rush out. They are the first ones there. They are there without any pay. It is their community and they are fighting their hearts out. They are bleeding. almost literallydoing all they can to prevent that structure from burning. to do all they can to force the fire back. They are not paid. It is without compensation. The Forest Service and smokejumpers are. there are others who are not paid. The others are not. They are the first there and often the last to leave. They are just into it because it is their community. I called James Lee Witt. pictured in the center of this photo. He very quickly got some regulations changed so volunteer firefighters could be reimbursed. Recently now they are receiving payment for the services they rendered. But the point is. people came from all over. Employers let volunteers leave workit was lost work. but still the main job had to be done fighting these fires. Students postponed attending classes at the University of Montana. or other classes. families left at home. coworkers who put in overtime to cover those who traveled to the West. The Red Cross and its hundreds of volunteers who were there when folks needed to see a friendly face. The various state agencies that worked diligently and expeditiously to implement emergency plans. The federal agencies that came forward to help put the fires out and begin to rebuild these communities. Specifically. Id like to commend FEMA. the Federal Emergency Management Agency for their efforts. On several occasions. they quickly released federal funds or waived personnel requirements. Cutting red tape so we could get the assistance we needed right away. I especially thank FEMA Director James Lee Witt who spent countless hours working with me and other folks in Montana. When these fires started to blow in Montana. James Lee Witt said he was really booked up with other. plans. but he dramatically changed his schedule so he could come to Montana. That made a huge difference in getting agencies to work together. and it cut so much of this redtape. FEMA is still working on recovery efforts. and we very much appreciate all they have done and continue to do. I also thank with the same enthusiasm the adjutant general of the Montana National Guard. Gene Prendergast. and all his troops. Gene really stepped up. This guy really cares. He mobilized his troops. who care just as much. He was also influential in working with Federal. State. and local agencies to coordinate plans and requests for Federal assistance. We owe Gene Prendergast a huge debt of gratitude. At the high point of the fires. there were well over 12.000 people fighting blazes in western Montana. That includes Forest Service firefighters and National Guard men and women. We had 3 activeduty battalions from the East coming to fight fires in Montana. People came from everywherefrom 48 States and 3 countriesto Montana. Across the West. some 30.000 brave individuals battled wildfires during this season. We did not lose any lives in our State. thanks to the combination of solid training. sensible fire strategy. and good luck. The dangers faced by these individuals. however. were obviously real. Think of the danger we put people into. Last year. we took time to remember the Mann Gulch fire. That was a huge fire in Montana which blew up about 50 years ago. Thirteen National Forest Service smoke jumpers died in that blowup. They were fighting a fire 10 miles away from Helena. 10 miles from the photo I showed earlier. It was not thought to be a fire that was going to threaten lives or property. An observer described the Mann Gulch fire with these words: A terrific draft of superheated air of tremendous velocity had swept up the hill exploding all inflammable material. causing a wall of flame 600 feet high to roll over the ridge and down the other side and continue over ridges and down gulches until the fuels wereso light that the wall could not maintain enough: heat to continue. This wall covered 3.000 acres in 10 minutes. Anything caught in the direct path of the heat blast perished. Just 6 years ago. we lost 14 smoke jumpers in a similar firestorm near Glenwood Springs. CO. This fire. like the Mann Gulch. was considered routine. and these were not even the most deadly fires in the Wests history. It is important to remember those who gave their lives fighting wildfires. It is also important to celebrate those who put their lives on the line day after day to keep our homes and communities safe. A simple thank you does not seem to be enough to show our appreciation for these people and for everything they have done. That is why I have come to the floor to announce I am introducing legislation to honor and commemorate the selfless sacrifices each of these individuals has made to keep our families and our homes safe. The legislation will direct the U.S. Forest Service. the Bureau of Land Management. the Federal Emergency Management Agency. and the U.S. Department of Defense to- work together to create a commemorative pin or badge that will be issued to each firefighter at the end of a fire season. This -will serve as an emblem of the vital service they have provided and a symbol of our gratitude. much as a soldier might receive a band to record a tour of duty. because those who fight wildfires really are soldiers who put their lives on the line every day in defense of the people. communities. the lands of America. These courageous men and women need to be recognized as the heroes they are. As we properly focus on the work these brave firefighters do for us. let us not forget the work we must do for them. for it is only by creating and funding sensible forest management policy and by guiding development to reduce the risk to homes and property posed by wildfires that we can keep more of our firefighters out of harms way and prevent future tragedies like Mann Gulch. As we commemorate our firefighters. let us make sure we rise to the task of putting aside our differences and working together for commonsense policies that will keep our forests healthy and firefighters safe. Again. I say thank you. thank you to all the heroesfirefighters. volunteers. Government employees. ordinary citizenswho pulled together to protect life and home in Montana and across the West. Please know that we are truly grateful for everything you have done.",5892,5892_wildfires_fires_fire_spruce,"['wildfires', 'fires', 'fire', 'spruce', 'wildfire', 'burned', 'forest', 'beetle', 'burning', 'bark']",wildfires - fires - fire - spruce - wildfire - burned - forest - beetle - burning - bark,1,TRUE,1060193357

104701,"Mr. President. this is part of a continuing effort to prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from advancing what we believe is a very illconceived directive to increase springtime releases of water from Missouri River upstream dams in an experiment to see if a controlled flood may improve the breeding habit of the pallid sturgeon. House language was added to prevent implementation of the ""controlled flood"" during consideration in the House Committee on Appropriations. The majority leader has entered an amendment. which we appreciate. in this bill which says no decision on final disposition of the Missouri River manual should be made this year. I thank him for that. That is one step in the right direction. This.. however. goes beyond and makes clear there is a broader policy involved. Rather than let the Fish and Wildlife Service dictate national priorities to the Congress. the administration. the States. and the people. I. believe the elected officials in Congress need to weigh in to protect human safety. property. and jobs. In sum. we ought to be able to do several things at once. The authorizing legislation for the dams and other structures on the Missouri River says that they should be to prevent floods. to enhance transportation. provide hydropower. and to facilitate recreation. Subsequent to those enacting statutes. the Endangered Species Act was adopted with the hope that we would stop the disappearance of endangered species and help recover them: My purpose here today. along with my bipartisan colleagues. is to assure that the multiple uses of the Missouri River may be pursued. As so many of my colleagues. I was a great fan of the work by Stephen Ambrose. ""Undaunted Courage."" I had a greatgreatgrandfather who was one of the laborers who pulled the boats up the Missouri- River. I find. it fascinating. It was truly a remarkable chapter in our Nations history. That chapter has come and gone and people have moved in and live and farm by the river. They are dependent upon the river for water supply. water disposal. hydropower. transportation. and. yes. in the upstream States. for recreation. While we have had continuing discussions throughout my career serving the State of Missouri over the proper uses of the river water between upstream and downstream States. I continue to assure my colleagues in the upstream States that if there are things we can do to help improve the recreational aspects of the impoundments on the river above thedams. I would be more than happy to do so. This amendmentvery short. very simple -says. simply put. that the Secretary. meaning the Secretary of the Army. who is the ultimate responsible official. may consider and propose alternatives for achieving species recovery other than the alternatives specifically prescribed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the biological opinion of the Service. In other words. they have already proposed .one thing. controlled spring floods. The Secretary may also propose other alternatives. This doesnt say that he has to. it says that he can do it. He may do it. It mandates that the Secretary shall consider the views of other Federal agencies. nonFederal agencies. and individuals to ensure that other congressionally authorized purposes are maintained. This amendment simply says. we enacted a number of different objectives for the Missouri River. Mr. Secretary. when you select an option. you have to take into consideration all of these specific congressionally authorized objectives. I believeand it makes a great deal of sensethat the Federal Government should prevent floods. not cause theni. It should be providing more safe and efficient transportation options. not monopolies for railroads. It should not be curtailing energy production from an environmentally clean source of energy. water power. during. peak summer periods of demand during an energy crisis. People in our State of Missouri cannot believe that we need to have this debate. They cannot believe that the Endangered Species Act does not have enough flexibifity in it to permit human safety and economic security to be considered. They cannot believe that their needs are necessarily subordinate to what the Fish and Wildlife Service said is the only way the pallid sturgeon can be saved. Unfortunately. what the Fish and Wildlife Service says goes. -And then to add insult to injury. after imposing their plan on the Corps of Engineers. the Corps of Engineers has to put the States and the citizens through the hoaxI say hoax advisedlyof a public comment period that is irrelevant to the Fish and Wildlife Service that has. in the past. demonstrated it will use its dictatorial power under the Endangered Species Act not just to put people out of business and increase damageto private property but to threaten human safety of urban and rural communities where there will be greater risk of flood and flood damage. This amendment on behalf of my colleagues gives the Corps of Engineers the -opportunity to propose alternative species recovery measures that help fish and dont hurt people. It requires the continuation of public input and directs that the Corps preserve the other authorized purposes for the Missouri River. The current Fish and Wildlife Service proposal.. which they offered as a dictate to the Corps of Engineers last July. saying you have 7 days to implement this plan that will flood Missouri and downstream States in the spring. is not some new proposal that just needs a little public sunlight to be fashioned into something that is sensible. It represents the ""my way or the highway"" approach to regulatory enforcement and the reincarnation of what has previously been rejected by the people and the States involved. A spring rise and low flow period was proposed by Fish and Wildlife through the Corps of Engineers in 1994. It was subjected to 6 months of public comment. and it was ridiculed at public forums from Omaha to Kansas City to .St. Louis to Memphis to Quincy to New Orleans to Onawa. IA. and elsewhere. This is what the people of the heartland of America said about the spring rise. I have a bad hand. and I can only lift a third of the transcripts at a time. but these are the comments that the Corps of Engineers received in 1994. Guess what. They didnt think much of the plan then for spring rise. President Clintons Secretary of Agriculture and his Secretary of Transportation criticized the plan in writing. The plan was then. shelved by the Clinton administration because of public opinion. They had their public comment. People did weigh in. and they said this is a disaster. The Clinton administration withdrew it. However. that plan was subsequently resurrected by the Fish and Wildlife Service. using the force of the socalled consultation process sufficient to impose its will on -the people in the States. In other words. the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to convince the public and the States of the wisdom of their plan. as represented by these comments. so they decided to force their plan by putting a gun to the head of the Corps. If the Fish and Wildlife Service cared about the views of the States and the public opinion of those who live in and around the basin and depend upon the Missouri River. we. would not be here today. There is very little hope that they would care about next years comments than they care about the comments people took pains to make in 1994 because they simply dont have to. The Fish and Wildlife Service gets to do what it wants because while they are required to allow public comment. they are not required to listen. And I guarantee you. when it comes to this plan. they have not listened. This process. as previously orchestrated. is more rigged than a WWF championship match. But for my citizens. the price of admission is the cost of losing a planning season. a levee. an export opportunity. a flood. and maybe even the loss of a life. Some may tell you that the Government can control this proposed flood. I know they wish that were the case. But wishes are not going to provide accurate weather forecasts in the temperamental heartland spring. Unless someone in the Corps can forecast weather accurately 5 to 10 days to 2 weeks in advance. there will be accidents. people will be hurt. and it will be because the U.S. Government decided to risk their safety for an experiment. When the Government releases pulses of water from the dams. that water cant be brought back. it is not retrievable. It takes 5 days to get to Kansas City. 10 days to get to St. Louis. and further down the river. even longer. On average. the river never floods. In the real world. though. it isnt the averages that hurt us but the extremes. I understand that a lot of people have drowned in lakes that average only 3 feet deep. With downstream tributary flow. we already have a natural ""spring rise"" every time it rains. and when that happens. a ""pulse"" released days before is a tragic gift courtesy of the Federal Government. Just 6 weeks ago. following a series of low pressure systems in the basin. in less than 5 days gauging stations in Missouri went from below normal stage to flood stage. Right in the heart of our State. in Herman. MO. the streamflow increased from 85.000 cubic feet per second to 250.000 cubic feet per second in 5 days. That is almost a threefold increase in the amount of water coming down that river. Now. neither the people of Herman nor the Corps of Engineers expected this dramatic tripling of the flows. but it shows the danger of intentionally increasing those flows during the spring season. and it shows what people in our State already know: We already have a spring rise. It is natural and it is dangerous. If the pallid sturgeon really liked spring rises. they would be coming out our ears. After the floods. we should have had little pallid sturgeons all over the place. The second part of the Fish and Wildlife plan is an artificially low summer flow. which inverts the historical natural hydrograph. For those who may be a little concerned about the terms. that means the river ""aint"" flowing like it used to flow before dams. The natural hydrograph is to have more water in the summer during the snowmelts in the upper basin. This natural pattern would be turned on its head if you had the releases in the spring and then low flows during the summer. It starves the hydropower generators of capacity during peak periods of energy demand. driving up the rates for customers. driving up the rates for Native American tribes and other citizens in rural areas. According to data from the Western Area Power Administration. ""Risk analysis including river thermal powerplants: Both capacity and energy losses increase exponentially as the summer flow decreases in July."" That means that when you cut the waterflow during the summer in peak cooling seasons. you get much greater than a straight line loss in capacity and energy production. The line doesnt go down like this. it goes up like that. That is what happens to power production when you reduce summer flows. The plan does call for continued production of energy. just not when people need it. The middle part of the summer is when airconditioning rates are the highest and when there is the greatest drain on electricity. Unless we no longer care about clean energy options. then we shoulds not be taking deliberate steps to increase the cost of power. Additionally. let me point out for our southern neighbors that low summer flows provide inadequate water to continue water commerce on the Missouri River and during Very low water periods on the Mississippi River. During the drought years. up to 65 percent of the flow in the Mississippi River below St. Louis comes from the Missouri River. Water commerce is important for another reason. One mediumsized 15barge tow can carry the same amount of grainusually going to the export marketsas 870 trucks. This one mediumsized tow is much better for safety. clean air. fuel efficiency. highway congestion. and the competitiveness of our shippers in the international marketplace than putting 870 trucks on the highway through congested metropolitan areas. Water commerce for our farmers. shippers. and exporters is a necessary insurance policy against high rates that occur when the absence of competition leaves shippers to the mercy of transportation monopolies. A key assumption of some is that freight carriers dont raise rates when they face no competition. That is a nice wish. but it is not a realistic assumption. Other forms of transportation do raise rates when competition is not present. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority. which did a study. higher shipping costs would add up to as much as $200 million annually to farmers and other shippers in Missouri. South Dakota. and all the States in between. not including the Lower Mississippi River States. A shipper from the. Omaha. NE. region told my office that he secures railroad rates of less than $25 per ton when they go up to Sioux City. where the river provides competition. but when he ships up to Sioux Falls. where the river doesnt go. where river transportation is not available. then rates double. I am pleased and proud to say there are many ongoing programs and practices to improvp Missouri River habitat. I have listened to the discussions that relate to this matter over the years. and there is some presumption that only the Federal Government should do something about it. That is false. There is that overtone. since Missouri strongly opposes the Federal Fish and Wildlife planon a bipartisan basis. I might addwe arent as dedicated to fish and wildlife as some of our friends in the Dakotas. .or Montana maybe. Well. Mr. President. no State in the basin dedicates as much money as Missouri does to fish and wildlife conservation measures. Most States just take payments from the PittmanRobertson and the WallopBreaux and licensing revenue. Some States have appropriations from their general fund. The citizens of Missouri have imposed upon themselves by referendum a State sales tax for conservation. That has enabled Missouri to spend as much as California on fish and wildlife. This year that total will be $140 million. Our State conservation tax has enabled Missouri to spend twice as much as Florida. 11 times moft than Massachusetts. 11 times more than Vermont. 9 times more than Nevada. and 3 times more than Illinois. According to the latest data from the Wildlife Conservation Fund of America. Missouri spends roughly 50 percent more on fish and wildlife than the Dakotas and Montana combined. Missouri spends 5 times more than South Dakota on fish and wildlife. and 10 times more than North Dakota. Almost all States raise money from hunting and fishing licenses and all States get Federal money. If you go beyond those sources. the difference between what Missouri citizens have set aside for fish and wildlife compared to our upstream neighbors. the numbers are staggering. In the latest years. the figures available to me. Missouri dedicated 60 times more from State taxes in the general fund than South Dakota. for example. I will not say anything beyond this except that Missouri citizens are doing their part. and certainly we encourage other States to follow the constructive example that Missouri has set. What have we done? What have we done for wildlife habitat? What have we done to conserve species. to preserve and help restore endangered species? Our Department of Conservation has acquired 72 properties in the Missouri River flood plain totaling almost 45.000 acres. Senator HARKIN of Iowa and I and others have requested funding fora number of ongoing habitat projects. and while two are funded in this bill. one was not funded. We have authorized and we have begun funding for a 60.000acre flood plain refuge between St. Louis and Kansas City. We authorize an addition of 100.000 acres of land acquisition in the lower basin to restore habitat. with almost 13.700 acres already acquired. I have been pleased to work with American Rivers and Missouri farm groups to authorize habitat restoration on the river. to create sandbars. islands. and side channels. These are the natural structures that support and facilitate species such as the pallid sturgeon. I regret to say this administration. as the last administration. requested no funds to start the project. and the subcommittee this year did no new starts. so a consensus approach is lying in state. We have financed over 21.740 acres of wetland easements from the Wetlands Reserve Program in Missouri. Missouri is very active with the Conservation Reserve Program. and farmers are signing up for filter strips along waterways to reduce runoff. -We are working in Missouri on an agroforestry flood plain initiative and have demonstrated tree systems that take out nearly threequarters of the phosphorous and nitrogen so it does not reach the waterways while providing excellent bird habitat. According to our Department of Natural Resources. river engineering efforts on the Mississippi River have paid big dividends~for endangered species. For example. at river mile 84 on the Upper Mississippi River. the Corps has created hard points in the river to separate a sandbar from the bank to create a nesting island for the federally endangered least tern. In addition. larval sturgeon have been collected in the resultant side channel. Four islands around mile 100 on the Upper Mississippi. were created by modifying existing navigational structures without"" interfering with water transport. Islands have flourished even through the flood of 1993. At river mile 40 on the Upper Mississippi. the Corps has established critical offchannel connectivity essential as overwintering and rearing habitat for many Mississippi River fishes. We know there are better approaches that do not hurt people. and that is where the focus has been in Missouri. and that is where the focus should be in Washington. The sooner we table the plan that is risky. untested. and dangerous. the sooner we can get to the plans that are tested and broadly supported.?Our bipartisan amendment is supported by members across the country: the National Waterways Alliance. National Corn Growers Association. American Soybean Association. American Farm Bureau Federation. National Association of Wheat Growers. National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. Agricultural Retailers Association. National Grain and Feed Association. and others. The Fish and Wildlife Service plan has been opposed strongly by the Southern Governors Association which issued another resolution opposing it early this year. The Fish and Wildlife plan is opposed strongly by our current Governor. Governor Holden. and his Department of Natural Resources which is just as knowledgeable and just as committed to the protection of the river they live on as the Federal field representatives who live in other regions and States. I say to all the Senators on the Mississippi River that objections were raised to the Fish and Wildlife Service plan in a recent letter to the President signed by nine Mississippi River Governors. These Governors include Governor Patton from Kentucky. Governor Sundquist from Tennessee. Governor Foster from Louisiana. Governor Musgrove from Mississippi. Governor Ryan from. Illinois. Governor Huckabee from Arkansas. Governor McCallum from Wisconsin. and Governor Holden from Missouri. This plan is opposed on a bipartisan basis by elected officials. by our late Governor Carnahan. by mayors. farmers. and the people all along the Missouri River. Our amendment seeks to add some balance in the decisionmaking process and attempts to permit the administration to do what is right to find ways to address species recovery that do not harm- people. that do not harm property. that do not interfere with. the other legitimate multiple uses of the Missouri River. I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this bipartisan amendment.

105891,"As I said. I am pleased to rise today to support introduction of the National Energy Security Act of 2001. At the request of the Majority Leader during the last Congress. Senator MURKowSKI and other Senators began the process of developing a solution to the energy ""fix"" in which we found ourselves in beginning in late Back then. OPEC cut crude oil production to force up world oil prices. It workedoil prices rose quickly from about $12 per barrel and hit a high of about $32 per barrel last spring. Our motorists were worried about the increasing cost of gasoline and truckers were concerned about rising fuel oil prices. Also. residential customers in the Northeast watched as their home heating oil bills skyrocketed. In the past dozen months the situation has worsened. Gasoline. fuel oil. and home heating oil prices remain high. Natural gas prices have tripled to about $6.00 per million Btus (British Thermal Units). Natural gas production has remained static even though the number of drilling rigs looking for gas has tripled over the last year. Further. natural gas in storage is just above 1 billion cubic feet. about half of what is usually in storage this time of year. Residential gas customers in some parts of the Nation have seen their winter heating bills triple. Wholesale electricity prices have risen significantly. In California. which is experimenting with a flawed electricity deregulation effort. electricity prices have been as high as $300 per megawatt hour (MwH) on the spot market. Thats about 30 cents per kilowatt hour or about 5 times what investor owned utilities in California are allowed to charge their customers. Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company are staggering under more than $10 billion in unpaid bills for power. California. due to a shortage of instate power generating facilities has been forced to import power from as far away as Texas and the Pacific Northwest. Power supplies in the Northwest are scarce and competition for supplies and fear that the California Utilities will be unable to pay their bills has forced up retail electricity prices in Oregon. Washington and my home state of Idaho. When the previous administration arrived in 1993 it announced its intent to drastically alter the way the Nation used energy. especially fossil fuels. President Clinton argued that a broad based Btu tax would force us away from coal. oil and natural gas to renewable energy from solar. wind and biomassthat objective has remained a hallmark of that administrations ""energy policy."" The President promised the tax would raise nearly $72 billion over five years (19941998) and marketed it as fair. helpful to the environment. that it would force down our dependence on foreign oil. and would have trivial impacts on consumers. In fact. it would have unfairly punished energy intensive states and industries. Estimates by the American Petroleum Institute and National Association of Manufacturers at the time predicted the tax would hurt exports. reduce GDP by $38 billion. and destroy as many as 700.000 American jobs. The administration claimed the tax was needed to balance the budget and fund large new spending programs to offset the negative impacts of the tax. They also claimed that crude oil imports would decline by 400.000 barrels per day. At the same time. DOEs own projections predicted the tax would shave oil import growth by less than onetenth after 10 years. DOE predicted that by the year 2000. Americans still would depend on foreign oil for threefifths of their total crude oil requirements. API testified: "". . . even if imports were to fall by the full 400.000 barrels a day claimed by the administration. the cost of $34 billion in lost GDP is excessive relative to other alternatives for improving energy security. Using the administrations optimistic predictions. the cost of the Btu tax works out to about $230 per barrel."" In the end. Congress refused to accept the Clinton administrations efforts to tax our relatively inexpensive energy sources to finance their grandiose tax and spend social agenda. Congress did agree to raise taxes on transportation fuels by 4.3 cents per gallon. a move Republicans tried to reverse during the 106th Congress. The past administrations obsession to reduce fossil fuel use as much as possible has put us in the position we find ourselves today. President Clinton said on March 7. 2000 at the White House: Americans should not want them [oil prices] to drop to $12 or $10 a barrel again because that . . . takes our mind off our business. which should be alternative fuels. energy conservation. reducing the impact of all this on global warming. Since they came to office in 1993: Domestic oil production is down 17 percent. domestic crude oil consumption is up 14 percent. and dependence on foreign sources of crude oil has risen to 56 percent of total crude requirements. By comparison. in 1973. during the Arab oil embargo. our dependence on foreign crude was 36 percent of our total crude oil requirements. The past administrations failure to encourage domestic oil production and production of coal and natural gas has lead us to this point. That administration refused to acknowledge that vast reserves of oil and gas offshore. in Alaska and in the Rocky Mountain overthrust area should play a role in reducing our dependence on imported oil. The Clinton administration in 2000 announced a ban on future exploration on most of the federal outer continental shelf until 2012. In 1996 the Administration resorted used the Antiquities Act to create the Grant StaircaseEscalante Monument thereby dening access to about 23 billion tons of mineable coal reserves in Utah. The U.S. Forest Service has issued road construction policies that are designed to restrict the energy industrys ability to explore for oil and gas on Forest Service lands. Former President Clinton vetoed legislation in 1995 that would have opened the Coastal Plain of the remote Alaska National Wildlife Reserve denying the nation access to an estimated 16 billion barrels of domestic crude oilwhich could amount to production of 1.5 million barrels per day over the next 20 yearsabout 10 percent of daily U.S. consumption. The Clinton administration ignored a report prepared by the National Petroleum Council. requested by the Energy Secretary. explaining how the nation can increase production and use of domestic natural gas resources from about 22 trillion cubic feet per year to more than 30 trillion cubic feet per year over the next 10 to 12 years. The past administration showed little interest in solving our domestic energy problems even as foreign oil producers have forced crude oil prices to over $30 per barrel and gasoline prices to almost $2.00 per gallondouble prices of only little more than a year ago. Mr. President. the past administration has acted in other ways designed to force us away from the use of readily available. relatively inexpensive fossil fuels. nuclear energy and hydropower. It chose especially to vilify and deny the use of our most abundant national energy resourcecoal. The U.S. has the worlds largest demonstrated coal reserve base and accounts for more than 90 percent of our total fossil energy reserves. At present rates of recovery and use. U.S. reserves will last more than 270 years. Coal is used to generate over 56 percent of our electricity supplyand about 88 percent of the Midwests electricity needs. Electricity from hydro represents about 10 to 12 percent of our electricity needs. Nuclear powerplants meet about 20 percent of our total electricity demand. Yet the past administration had a dim view of these sources and took steps to reduce their use. For example. former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt talked openly about ""tearing down dams"" in the West to restore habitat for fish. ignoring the power and transportation benefits they provide. And. the past administration imposed new. often impossible criteria that must be met before federal licenses can be reissued. Many existing hydro projects will seek relicensing over the next several decades. The past administration also vetoed legislation designed to create a permanent nuclear waste storage facility and which fulfills a longstanding promise by the federal government to create such a facility. Without a federal storage facility. U.S. nuclear generating stations. which are running out of onsite storage capacity may be forced to begin shutting down some operations. There are too many more examples of the past administrations failure to produce a coherent. balanced national energy plan. The result of this failure is tight energy supplies and high prices. Solving these problems requires tough choices and I suggest that we begin now by pursuing a number of short and long term objectives. I think the bill we are introducing today addresses these challenges. Mr. President. I want to touch briefly on two aspects that are of great concern to me and my fellow Idahoans. Chairman MURKOWSKI has already gone through it in some detail. The bill contains provisions of great importance to the future of nuclear energy. which currently accounts for about twenty percent of U.S. electricity demand. Nuclear energy is a clean. safe. reliable technology which provides baseload power at low cost. The increase in natural gas prices has shown us the danger of relying on natural gas for all of our new electricity generation. Other countries have adopted the advanced nuclear technologies developed in this country and are putting them to use. In fact there is much excitement in the energy industry over plans to build a new type of nuclear plantcalled ""pebble bed reactor""-in South Africa. I believe at some point in the future we will once again appreciate the value of nonemitting energy such as nuclear. and choose to construct additional nuclear generating facilities in the U.S. For this reason. I am working with my colleague. Senator DOMENICI. to develop other proposals regarding the nuclear energy option and we hope to have additional legislation soon for the Senate to consider. The legislation also provides important tax incentives to encourage the use of geothermal energy. I have personal experience with what a wonderful role geothermal can play in our energy mix because the Idaho Statehouse in Boise and other buildings in the downtown area are heated with geothermal energy. In the right applications. geothermal is a clean. efficient energy source available for our use and because there are no ongoing fuel costs and relatively inexpensive maintenance costs. after the initial capital investment. it is a very low cost energy option. Finally. Mr. President. I want to address the matter of power from hydroelectric facilities. upon which the Pacific Northwest is highly dependent. The relicensing process for hydroelectric facilities is becoming increasingly costly and timeconsuming. It now takes more than five years to relicense a facilityup from only 9 months in 1980 according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Hydropower currently accounts for about 12 percent of the electricity generated in the United States and it produces that power without air pollution or the greenhouse gas emissions. Under current law. several federal agencies are required to set conditions for licenses without regard to the effects those conditions have on project economics. energy benefits. impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and values protected by other statutes and regulations. Far too often the relicensing process is plagued with agency disagreements and inconsistent demands. A very large number of public and privately owned hydro facilities will be tip for relicensing over the next ten years. Some may be abandoned if the relicensing process becomes prohibitively expensive and timeconsuming. The legislation being introduced today will help streamline the process and make the involved agencies more fully accountable for their decisions. The legislation does not change or modify any existing environmental laws. nor does it remove regulatory authority from various agencies. It does not call for the repeal of mandatory conditions on a FERC issued license. It is clear to me and many of my colleagues that hydropower is at risk and one of our most important tasks here in the Senate is to develop policies that lead to an energy strategy that will ensure an adequate supply of reasonably priced. reliable energy to all Americans in an environmentally responsible manner. The relicensing of nonfederal hydropower can and should continue to be an important strategy. In addition. we should work with our Western Hemisphere neighbors to help them increase their crude oil and natural gas production. We should provide relief to consumers by eliminating the 4.3 cents a gallon tax on motor gasoline enacted in 1993. We need to step away from punitive. command and control environmental regulations and move toward performance based regulatory concepts that offer the regulated community opportunities to find flexible approaches to reducing emissions of legally regulated contaminants. We must carefully assess the capabilities of our energy production and delivery systems to find opportunities to improve system productivity. efficiency and reliability. We must ensure that sufficient funds are available to help those with lower incomes to weatherize their homes and pay their energy bills. While renewable energy sources provide only about 3 percent of total U.S. demand for energy. we should continue to provide incentives for our citizens to use wind. solar. and other renewables. We should encourage motor vehicle manufacturers to ensure that consumers have access to safe and highly efficient cars and trucks. We must realize that we are part of the problem. Our unwillingness to develop our own abundant oil. gas and coal resources dooms us to greater dependence on foreign sources. especially for crude oil. We must make the conscious choice to carefully find and develop our resources while protecting our environment. I conclude by drawing attention to a portion of this bill that is increasingly valuable. that is the area of new technology. Some who will argue against this bill would suggest that it is merely a reason to fall back to our habits of old. That is not true. We want to and will continue to fund the new technology. much of it started in the decade of the 1990s. It is clearly important. We are not always going to have hydrocarbons around. and we should not be that dependent upon them. But in the short term. in the next several decades. as we are using our resources and fueling our economy. we need to look at nuclear technology and new clean coal technology so we can use the abundance of these resources and in an environmentally sound way. In my State of Idaho. we are dependent on hydropower. There are many. including the past administration and many of their devotees. who would suggest the dams on those rivers that produce that clean source of energy. nonpolluting. nongreenhouse gasemitting. that those dams ought to be breached. They insist that if the dams are not removed then they ought to be regulated in a much more stringent way. In fact. the licensing process the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has as a part of its responsibility to renew these hydro facilities is one that I am working on. And within this legislation is a reform of the licensing process. not to change it and take stakeholders or interested parties away from it. but to ask them to perform their responsibilities in a timely fashion and in a responsible fashion. Why should it take 10 years to relicense a hydro facility and cost millions upon millions of dollars that ultimately the consumer has to pay? If it needs retrofitting. if it needs improvement of technology for environmental reasons. those are conclusions that can be drawn in a reasonably quick way. and managed responsibly. so that we can balance out our energy needs. The legislation the Senate now has before us will be coupled with the work the Bush administration is doing now through their Cabinet level working group. This administration wants an energy policy. too. and it is their goal to produce one for the American people. Our economy depends on an abundant supply of environmentally sound. relatively lowcost energy. It is the wealth of our country. It is what drives this marvelous economic engine of ours. And it does something very simpleit puts money in the pocketbook of the worker. It turns the lights on in his or her home. It helps educate our children. It does all of the wonderful things we in America have grown to expect. Why should we suggest that we ought to have anything less if we can do it with the environment in mind and at a relatively low cost. That can be accomplished in a policy in which the Federal Government promotes the concept of energy production instead of setting up one trip wire after another to disallow it from happening. I look forward to the coming debate. I think it is critical that all of us get ourselves involved and educated in the issues at hand. These two pieces of legislation go a long way toward allowing that to happen.",3,3_oil_gas_energy_drilling,"['oil', 'gas', 'energy', 'drilling', 'gasoline', 'prices', 'renewable', 'drill', 'wind', 'barrels']",oil - gas - energy - drilling - gasoline - prices - renewable - drill - wind - barrels,1,TRUE,1070005155

114399,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to announce that I am joined by TOM LANTOS and 27 of our colleagues in introducing a bill to reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA). This bipartisan. conservation incentive program helps to protect the worlds most valuable tropical forests through ""debt for nature"" mechanisms. In the 105th Congress I introduced the TFCA with our former colleagues Lee Hamilton and John Kasich. It was overwhelmingly approved by the House by a vote of 35661. passed the Senate under unanimous consent and became Public Law 105214. The TFCA was developed with the support and input of respected environmental organizations such as The Nature Conservancy. the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation International. Their support and ongoing commitment to this program are appreciated and commendable. The United States has a significant national interest in protecting tropical forests in developing countries. Tropical forests -provide a wide range of benefits. They harbor 5090% of the Earths terrestrial biodiversity. They act as ""carbon sinks."" absorbing massive quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. thereby reducing greenhouse gases. They regulate rainfall on which agriculture and coastal resources depend. and they are of great importance to regional and global climate. Furthermore. tropical forests are breeding grounds for new medicines. Twenty five percent of prescription drugs come from tropical forests. The United States National Cancer Institute has identified over 3000 plants that are active against cancer. Seventy per.cent of them can be found in rain forests. Regrettably. tropical forests are rapidly disappearing. The latest figures indicate that 30 million acres (an area larger than the State of Pennsylvania) were lost each year. The heavy debt burden of many countries is a contributing factor because often they must resort to exploitation of their natural resources (particularly the extraction of timber. oil. and precious metals) to generate revenue to service their external debt. At the same time. poor governments tend to have few resources available to set aside and protect tropical forests.",6159,6159_tropical_tfca_forests_forest,"['tropical', 'tfca', 'forests', 'forest', 'eai', 'conservation', 'gabon', 'bangladesh', '4654', 'swaps']",tropical - tfca - forests - forest - eai - conservation - gabon - bangladesh - 4654 - swaps,1,TRUE,1070037171

118658,Mr. President. I rise today to introduce three bills called the Great Lakes Initiative which are designed to protect the five Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are one of our Nations most precious natural resources. They contain onefifth of the worlds fresh water supply and provide safe drinking water to millions of people every day. The Great Lakes also play a vital role in the economies of the Great Lakes States. including recreation. tourism. commercial shipping. industrial and agriculture. That is why I am introducing legislation today to protect this vital resource for the use. benefit. and enjoyment of present and future generations of Americans. Three bills make up this new Great Lakes Initiative: (1) the Great Lakes Water Protection Act. (2) the Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act. and (3) the Great Lakes Preservation Act. The first bill. the Great Lakes Water Protection Act. would protect the Great Lakes from environmentally dangerous oil and gas drilling.

130586,"Mr. Chairman. I rise today to voice my reasons for voting against final passage of H.R. 1646. the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. I wish for my colleagues and constituents to know the reasons for my action. There were many good provisions in H.R. 1646 that I am glad were in the final bill that the House passed. I support the sale of Kidd class destroyers to Taiwan. I support the call for moving the United States Embassy in Israel to the capital of Israel. Jerusalem. I also voted for several amendments that made H.R. 1646 a better bill. I joined my colleagues in voting for Mr. DELAYS amendment to protect United States servicemen from the clutches of the United Nations new international Criminal Court. Americas service men and women serve our nation under our Constitution. not international bureaucrats under a foreign flag. I am pleased that this House voted to pass the amendment of the distinguished gentleman from California. Mr. LANTOS. prohibiting United States military aid to Lebanon until they step up their efforts to stop terrorist attacks against Israel. I am particularly pleased that the Hyde Amendment restoring the Mexico City policy was added to the final bill. Despite these improvements. I could not vote for final passage of this bill for two reasons. The first reason is the failure of this House to pass the amendment of my friend and colleague from Colorado. Mr. TANCREDO. I cannot support a bill that authorizes $118 million for rejoining the United Nations Education. Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO is a profoundly antiwestern. antiAmerican organization. President Ronald Reagan was correct in withdrawing the. United States from this. group. and I will not vote to send my constituents tax dollars to an unelected intelligentsia who hate this country. The second reason I voted against this bill is because of language urging United States acceptance of the Kyoto treaty on the environment. There is no way I could vote for this bill with the language intact. This provision is unsound constitutionally and economically. The Kyoto language is unsound constitutionally because the other body has refused to ratify this treaty. The Constitution specifically reserves the treaty ratification power to the Senate. This house has no place urging the President to enforce a treaty that our country is not bound by. We have very strict laws restricting air and water pollution. If the House of Representative thinks these laws arent strict. enough. which I do not believe. then the House should pass a bill changing those laws. International negotiations are not the way the Founding Fathers intended for our environmental laws to be changed. More importantly. Mr. Chairman. the Kyoto treaty is monumentally flawed. If ratified it would require the United States and other developed countries to reduce their emission of socalled ""greenhouse gasses"" at least 7% below 1990 levels by 2010. At the same time. developing countries. such as China. Brazil. and India. were exempted from the greenhouse requirements. If implemented. the Kyoto treaty would have driven manufacturing industries entirely out of the United States. The United States already has strict Clean Air laws. Requiring a 7% decline in emissions for every industry would impose enormous costs on manufacturers and has not been scientifically proven to prevent global warming. If given the opportunity to choose between a country with these strict laws and a nation that was not bound to reduce emissions. I am of no doubt as to which country that firm will move to. In addition to driving industry offshore. full implementation of the Kyoto treaty would require increases in gasoline and electricity prices of up to 50%. and an estimated job loss of 2.4 million. according to one study. Mr. Chairman. the Clinton Administration did not sign a treaty at Kyoto. they signed a death sentence for the American economy. President Bush sensibly announced on March 28 that the United States would not take steps to implement the Kyoto treaty. I could not join this House in urging our President to destroy the American economy. and voted against H.R. 1646.

151484,"in bringing before the Senate H.R. 2217. the Interior and related agencies bill for fiscal year 2002. as amended. by the Senate Appropriations Committee. This is the first of the 13 annual appropriations measures to be considered by the Senate this year. In my opinion. this is a wellcrafted bill. It balances both the needs of the American people and the resources available to the committee. We only have so much money available and ""we aint going to spend what we aint got."" That being the situation then. I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill in a timely fashion so we can proceed to conference with the House of Representatives. We have gotten a late start this year and we have to work hard and long to catch up. Darkness may have fallen. from time to time. before we catch up on these appropriations bills. H.R. 2217 provides more than $1.2 billion in muchneeded funding to attack the deferred maintenance problems at our national parks. our national wildlife refuges. our national forests. and other federal. recreational facilities across this nation. The bill would provide $480 million to the National Park Service. $108 million to the -Fish and Wildlife Service. $78 million to the Bureau of Land Management. and $541 million to the Forest Service for literally hundreds. hundreds and hundreds of important maintenance projects. In addition. the bill restores $35 million in abandoned mine cleanup funds that were unwisely proposed to be cut by the administration. We are not going down that road. Mr. President. It restores nearly $80 million in proposed cuts to the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey. a matter of great importance to many of our colleagues. The bill fully funds the construction needs of the next six schools on the priority list of the Bureau of Indian Affair*. while increasing funding for the Indian Health Service. It increases funding for important energy research programs overseen by Department of Energy. another issue of particular importance to those from the West. Finally. this bill provides nearly $895 million in funding for various cultural agencies: agencies such as the Smithsonian Institution. the National Gallery of Art. the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. the National Endowment for the Arts. the National Endowrlent for the Humanities. and the Office of Museum Services. I am proud of the fact that the committee has kept its previous commitment. and has fully funded the Conservation Spending Category established in title VIII of last years Interior appropriations bill. Included in that amount is $406 million for federal land acquisition. $221 million for State and other conservation programs such as endangered species programs and wetland conservation programs. $137 million for historic preservation programs. an additional $50 million for the PaymentInLieuofTaxes program. and $180 million for Federal infrastructure improvements. This is a wellbalanced bill. given the demands placed on the committee as a result of 1.799 Member requests versus the resources available to it. Despite that. I know there- are Members who are passionate about some of the programs funded in this bill. and they would like to increase funding in one area or another. I appreciate that. I respect the right of every Member to come to the floor and offer such an amendment. But let me unfurl the warning flag. As reported by the Appropriations Committee. this bill is fully consistent with the 302(b) allocation provided to the Interior Subcommittee. In short. in plain. simple. mountain language. that means there is no extra money on the table waiting to be spentnone. no extra money waiting on the table. waiting to be spent. Friends. Romans. countrymen. .lend me your ears: There is no extra money on the table. Any amendment proposing to increase spending in one area of the bill will have to be offset with a cut in some other area. Any Senator Who wishes to add money may have to think whether or not he wants to take that money away from CONRAD BURNS or the minority leader or the majority leader or the humble slave. ROBERT C. BYRD. With respect to offsets. let me add that Senator BURNS and I. as managers of this bill. will generally oppose amendments which propose to cut the socalled travel and administrative expenses accounts. The agencies funded in this bill have done a good job generally in trimming these expenses to the bone. and unless Members are willing to offer real. honest to goodness programmatic cuts as a way to pay for their amendments. we will oppose all bogus offsets. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor. I have heard it said that some Senators think we are working too hard in the Senate. Let the record show that a great stillness fell over the Chamber upon my saying that. I have heard rumors that some Senators are concerned that we are working too late. toolong. too hard. It is mortifying to hear such rumors. I can remember when.for Easter Sunday we were out on Friday and came back here on Monday. We didnt used to hve socalled ""breaks."" We were also in session Mondays through Fridays. and sometimes we were in on Saturdays. God made the universeall of creation. the beasts of the fields. the fowl of the. air. fruits and herb yielding seedand he made man. not in 3 days. He didnt have a 3day work week. We have gotten used to 3day workweeks here. come in late on Tuesday. vote late on Tuesday. vote on Wednesday. vote Thursday. and be out Friday. out Saturday. and out Sunday. God said keep the Sabbath day holy. But that is not why the Senate lets out on Sunday. Let us not be stunned if we are asked to work a little later or a little longer. I would be happy to start voting on Monday and vote late on Friday. I would just as soon be here as to be at home on Saturday mopping the floor. Let some of these Senators learn how to mop the floor for their wives. Then they. too. will probably be married 64 years. as I have been. Mop the floor. keep the wrists and the fingers strong. There is no arthritis in my fingers. They tremble. but the bones are strong. The wrists are strong. You would be surprised how many men I can wrestle to -their knees with these strong wrists. These strong wrists come from mopping the floors. Yes. I mop the bathroom. I mop the kitchen floor. I mop the utility room. I vacuum. I dust. It is good for me. It keeps me humble. I even clean the commodes around my house. Things have changed in this country. It used to be that we ate on the inside of the house and went outside to the toilet. But anymore we eat on the outside of the House and go inside to the toilet. A Senator? Surely. a Senator wouldnt be concerned about working a little longer or a little later. We have become spoiled. It is all right for Senator REID and me to become spoiled on Fathers Day. But to say that we dont want to vote on Mondays. and we dont want to vote on Tuesdays until after the conferencewe didnt even have weekly conferences here when I was majority whip. We Democrats didnt have conferences every Tuesday. We didnt need them. But when I ran for the office of United States Senator for the eighth consecutive 6year term. I didnt say just sign me up for 3 days a week. I didnt tell the majority leader when I was sworn in here. dont count on me on any Fridays or Saturdays. I didnt say that. I hope this is mere rumor that I hear that certain Senators have been complaining that they have been working too long. too late. too many days a week. I hope the majority leader will keep us in late tonight. I hope he will keep us in late tomorrow night. if we dont finish this bill. I hope he will say we will be in Friday. and with votes. if we dont finish this bill today. And if we arent finished by Saturday. I hope the leader will say: Lets go at it. boys. We will be in Saturday. But if there is a Senator who is complaining about working too hard. Mr. Majority Whip. tell them where my office is. While we are on this bill. I am for working. I want to get this bill finished. We have 12 more appropriations bills behind this bill. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor today to offer any amendment they may have and to allow us to conclude debate on this measure no later than tomorrow so I can be with Lady Byrd and my little dog. Billy Byrd. The bill and report have been available for more than a week. and Senator BURNS and I are here ready and willing to work with our colleagues. Mr. President. I thank. at this time. my colleague. Mr. BURNS. for his steady hand and for the leadership he has demonstrated in the markup. in the hearings on the bill. and for his splendid cooperation. for his always charitable attitude toward other Senators. and for his fairness. I yield the floor.",4148,4148_interior_cara_nrra_conservation,"['interior', 'cara', 'nrra', 'conservation', 'forest', 'mop', 'humanities', 'parks', 'wildlife', 'riders']",interior - cara - nrra - conservation - forest - mop - humanities - parks - wildlife - riders,0.947371966,TRUE,1070047676
151930,Mr. Chairman. I want to commend my colleague from Michigan. This is a solution though. that is looking for a problem. There is not one State in the Great Lakes Basin that allows offshore drilling. not one. In Michigan. there is a moratorium on new directional angle drilling wells. What are we doing with this amendment? This amendment is not about protecting the. Great Lakes. For instance. it does nothing to address the potential for diversion of our fresh Great Lakes water. This amendment goes in a direction that I hope many in this chamber find disagreeable as it deeply involves the federal government in Great Lakes decisionmaking. I trust my Governor. I trust the Govemors of the Great Lakes States to be in charge of the water of the Great Lakes States. As a matter of fact. underneath the Great ?Lakes today. there are roughly 22.000 barrels of crude oil that float per hour under the Great Lakes. There are 550 offshore wells operated by Canadians. This bill addresses none of that. There are 5 million tons of oil bobbing around on the Great Lakes every year via cargo ship. which leads to an average of 20 spills a year on our Great Lakes. This amendment does nothing to address any of those issues. This amendment is not about protecting the Great Lakes. instead. it is about the federal government going into the State of Michigan and telling the legislators in Lansing that they do not know what theyre doing. There are some great protections of our Great Lakes. and I trust those Govemors. and I trust those Great Lakes state legislators to do the right thing. I want to say it again. because this is very important. and Ive heard it 10 times if Ive heard it once. that somebody is out there trying to build an oil rig in the Great Lakes and that President Bush is leading the charge. This is ridiculous. There is not one State in the Great Lakes Basin that permit offshore drilling. Not one. There is a moratorium on new licenses for directional drilling in the State of Michigan today. So what is the purpose for the Bonior Amendment? Mr. Chairman. I do not believe that a bureaucrat in Washington. DC. whose only experience with Michigans Upper Peninsula is a picture in the National Geographic. is better equipped to protect our shoreline and our Great Lakes. I want the people who live on the Great Lakes to make those decisions. The gentlewoman from Ohio talked about HOMES. the acronym by which schoolchildren learn the names of the Great Lakes. HOMES is appropriate because the people who make their homes in the Great Lakes States should be making decisions about the Great Lakes. Why? Because we live there. We see the water. we see the pollution. we fought back and reclaimed Lake Erie. We can again eat the fish that swim in our lakes. Why? Because the people of the Great Lakes States took action. It is nothing that Congress did. That is why this argument should not betaking place on the floor of the United States House. it should be taking place in the legislatures of the Great Lakes States. Mr. Chairman. I am passionate about the Great Lakes. but we have a true difference of opinion on the proper role of Congress in this debate. For example. look at the issue of water diversion. There is a bill in this House to empower Congress to decide what happens on diversion issues in the Great Lakes. The last I checked. the dry states of the Plains and Southwest could use a bit more extra water. and. the last I checked. there aremore members from those states in this chamber than from Great Lakes States. These issues have no business in this Chamber. It has all the business in the chambers in our State legislatures back home. This is a solution that is looking for a problem. There is a package of bills in the House to address this issue in a manner that doesnt encroach on our States rights. One concerns the diversion and export of Great Lakes water. Another is a resolution urging States to continue the ban on offshore drilling in our Great Lakes and that goes after those 550 wells currently in operation in Canada. It is important to remember that what the Federal Government can give us. they can take away. Pretty soon. maybe the faces of this Chamber will change. and maybe pretty soon the folks in this Chamber will decide that we want oil production from the Great Lakes. And since most of the members of this Chamber do not reside in the Great Lakes Basin. nor do the Washington. DC bureaucrats overseeing federal policy. the decision may come from Washington to tap into the Great Lakes oil reserves. There is only one thing that can protect us from that: Our state legislators and our governors of the Great Lakes States. Mr. Chairman. I want to urge this body to reject the Bonior Amendment. to throw out all the rhetoric about how without this amendment there will be polluted water. people rushing to put oil rigs on the Great Lakes. and how oil will start gushing into the waters of Lake Michigan or Superior. This is just absolutely untrue. What I would encourage the gentleman from Michigan to do is to work with us. We should take a look at studying the quality of those pipes that are pumping those 22.000 barrels an hour under the Great Lakes today. Let us get together and tell Canada. get off the water. Shut down those rigs that are pumping on the water as we speak. We should work together to ensure that those ships bobbing around on the Lakes carrying 5 million tons of oil are safe and dont continue to average 20 spills each year. Does the gentleman want to do something for the Great Lakes? Let us partner with our states and help solve this issue. The federal government should not come in and flex its muscles and tell state legislators that they really dont know what they are doing. I used to be an FBI agent. and when I would walk into a local police station and tell them the federal government was here to help. I can tell you I never received a warm welcome. And I can tell you that passing legislation like the Bonior Amendment ensures that Congress will not receive a warm welcome in the State halls of Lansing and othei Great Lakes capitals. Mr. Chairman. this is an important issue. It is an extremely important issue. I grew up on a lake. I want that lake safe for my kids. I want them to go to Lake Michigan and be able to play in the water and not have to worry about turning green when they come home. I want them to be able to eat the fish in Lake Erie. I mean no disrespect to this Chamber. but. I just came from the State legislature. and I have seen the good things that Congress can do. and I have seen the bad things that Congress can do. I also served with some very bright people in that State legislature. I served with a great Governor who understood that we had to protect our Great Lakes while we have a moratorium on new drilling. I want those people empowered to make a difference for our Great Lakes. I would urge this todays strong rejection of the Federal Government encroaching into the business of the Great Lakes States. I applaud all of the Members for getting up on the floor and talking about their passion for protecting one of our greatest natural resources. Well.. let us do just that. but let us be a partner with the States. Talk to our state legislators. talk to our governors. They will be with us. Talk to the people who live there- and ask them who do they best trust to protect our Great Lakes? Is it the people that get up every morning and eat breakfast. go to work. and send their children to school in the shadow of the Lakes. or is it a bureaucrat that they have never met in the halls of some Washington. DC bureaucracy? Or is it a future member of Congress from a dry state like California who stands up. maybe 50 years from now. and argues that it is worth the risk to stick a pipe in fresh water to extract oil? The answer is clear. our States are the best guardians of the Great Lakes. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the Great Lakes today. Stand up for the environment of Michigan. Ohio. Pennsylvania. Indiana. Minnesota. New York. and Wisconsin. Stand up for these states by rejecting the Federal Governments role of encroaching on our ability back home to protect our greatest natUral resource. I would urge this bodys rejection of the Bonior Amendment.,595,595_lakes_lake_freshwater_sediment,"['lakes', 'lake', 'freshwater', 'sediment', 'great', 'restoration', 'basin', 'water', 'fresh', 'invasive']",lakes - lake - freshwater - sediment - great - restoration - basin - water - fresh - invasive,0.890761257,TRUE,1070047636

172211,"Mr. President. today. I commemorate the 38th Anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964. which was signed into law on September 3. 1964. by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The Wilderness Act of 1964 established a National Wilderness Preservation System ""to secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness."" The law reserves to Congress the authority to designate wilderness areas. and directs the Federal land management agencies to review the lands under their responsibility for their wilderness potential. The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest Service land in 54 wilderness areas. Now. the wilderness system is comprised of more than a 100 million acres that are administered by four Federal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. and the Bureau of Land Management. the Fish and Wildlife Service. and the National Park Service in the Department of the Interior. As we in this body know well. the passage and enactment of legislation of this type is a remarkable accomplishment. It requires steady. bipartisan commitment. institutional support. and direct leadership. The United States Senate was instrumental in shaping this very important law. and this anniversary gives us the opportunity to recognize this role. I have been very pleased to see this body return to the tradition of designating wilderness since the 35th anniversary of the act in 1999. The 106th Congress passed. and President Clinton signed. a total of eight wilderness bills adding more than 1 million acres of public land to the National Wilderness Preservation System. This is the largest number of acres of wilderness added to the system since 1994 and is a stark contrast to the 105th Congress. which did not enact any wilderness designations. While the 107th Congress may not surpass the wilderness achievements of the 106th. there are a number of wilderness bills pending in the 107th Congress. several of which are likely to become law before the end of the year. The designation of the James Peak Wilderness in Colorado and additions to the Black Elk Wilderness in South Dakota have already been approved by Congress and signed into law by President Bush. Bills designating new wilderness areas in Washington. Nevada. and Puerto Rico are likely to move forward this fall. while others. such as those to designate wilderness in Washington State and California. may see hearings or other congressional action. Many would agree that more must be done to protect our wild places. but much has been done already. In commemoration of anniversaries like this one. the Senate should celebrate our accomplishment. on behalf of the American people. in the protection of these wild places..",43,43_wilderness_park_lands_monument,"['wilderness', 'park', 'lands', 'monument', 'land', 'parks', 'acres', 'recreation', 'forest', 'trails']",wilderness - park - lands - monument - land - parks - acres - recreation - forest - trails,1,TRUE,1070159988

197652,"Mr. President. I thank the manager of the bill. I commend the managers and the bipartisan group who worked on this bill. It is vitally needed. and I rise in strong support of it. Mr. President. this long overdue piece of legislation will finally bring some common sense to forest management in our Nation. Currently. conditions in our Nations forests are terrible. The poor state of our forests is due in large part to a lack of active forest management efforts to reduce undergrowth and remove dead and dying trees to restore forest health. According to the Society of American Foresters. ""As a result of 80 years of fuels accumulation and several years. of drought. the potential for catastrophic wildfire is at an all time high in many regions of the United States."" An estimated 190 million acres of Federal forests and rangelands in the United States. an area twice the size of California. face a high risk of catastrophic wildfire. Decades of an accumulation of dense undergrowth and brush. along with drought. insect infestation and disease. and the presence of invasive exotic species have made our forests vulnerable to these environmentally destructive wildfires. According to Secretary of Agriculture. Ann Venman. last year was the second worst fire season in modern history with over 7.2 million acres burnedan area larger than Maryland and Rhode Island combined. The States of Arizona. Colorado. and Oregon registered their largest and most destructive wildfires ever. It was also the most expensive fire season ever costing Federal taxpayers $1.6 billion. When the season ended. 23 firefighters were dead. tens of thousands of people fled their homes and more than 2.000 buildings were destroyed. This devastation was only eclipsed by the 2000 fire season where more than 8 million acres of forests burned at a Federal cost of $1.4 billion. This year. as of the first week in October. we have had a total of 67.500 fires that have burned over 3.2 million acres at a cost of over $550 million. Worse than that. over 20 wildland firefighters have lost their lives this year. The time for addressing the problem of our unhealthy forests is long overdue. Current efforts to reduce excessive fuel loads. underbrush. and dead and dying trees are taking for too long due to senseless bureaucratic delay. According to the U.S. Forest Service. it can take up to 8 years to plan and execute relatively routine fuels reduction projects8 years. Does anyone here believe that this is responsible forest management? In May of this year. the Government Accounting Office (GAO) released the results of a survey that confirms that the large numbers of appeals filed by environmental interest groups are delaying efforts to restore the health of our Nations forests through the thinning of overgrown and diseased areas. These delays increase the threat of severe forest fires which threaten human life. old growth trees. habitat for endangered species and private property. These endless and meritless appeals result in nothing but inaction and increased bureaucratic costs. If we do not address this problem now. we risk losing many of Americas most pristine forests to wildfire devastation. Congress needs to pass legislation to streamline and expedite these forest thinning and fuels reduction efforts. I believe the H.R. 1904 will accomplish this goal. The Senate compromise to H.R. 1904 is designed to cut through unnecessary red tape and speed up the review and approval process for forest health restoration projects. while at the same time preserving the appropriate environmental review process. Specifically this bill establishes procedures to expedite forest and rangeland restoration projects focusing on lands near communities in the wildland urban interface. that are in condition class 3 (high fire risk) areas located in proximity to a municipal watershed or water supply system. that provide Important habitat for endangered species where the risk of catastrophic wildfire threatens these species. and where insect infestation. disease and old age are destroying forests and increasing the chance of wildfire. The Senate compromise also contains language for the protection of old growth or large trees in tile implementation of hazardous fuels reduction projects. This legislation requires authorized hazardous fuels reduction projects to be consistent with the applicable forest and resource management plans. along with other administrative policies or decisions applicable to Federal land. The amount of acreage eligible for authorized fuels reduction projects under this legislation is lillited to 20 million acres. In addition to allowing for an environmental assessment and expedited administrative appeals. this legislation does allow for judicial review. As a part of this review. this bill requires lawsuits to be filed in the district court where the project is located. It limits temporary injunctions to 60days. subject to renewal. Finally. this legislation directs the courts to balance the short- and longterm environmental effects of undertaking a project versus those of not undertaking a project. The problem of excessive forest fuels build is not just a Western problem. It is a National problem. The expedited reduction of forest fuels and the thinning of underbrush would greatly improve the health of Missouris forests. There has been a significant increase in the buildup of these fuels in National and State Forest land in the State of Missouri as a result of recent tornadoes. several years of drought. oak decline and oak mortality. Oak mortality is the most pressing problem in Missouris forests. As of January 2003. oak mortality due to drought. insects. and fungi have affected 41 percent of the Mark Twain National Forests 1.5 million acres. and caused an estimated loss of more than 30 million dollars worth of red oak timber. Dead limbs and debris in this area also reduce food for wildlife. and contribute to fuels buildups. which increases the dangers of wildfires. In turn. these wildfires endanger wildlife habitat areas. healthy watersheds and neighboring private lands. Missouri also has huge volume of dying forest land throughout southern Missouri as a result of infestation by an insect known as the red oak stem bore. According to Dr. Gene Garrett of the University of Missouri School of Natural Resources. who has studied and taught forestry for over 33 years. ""Roughly 33 percent of the 23 million acres of the interior highlands in the scenic Missouri Ozarks are infested by this red oak stem bore. Dr. Garrett goes on to say that ""this insect and associative disease complex is by far the greatest threat to the oak component of the interior highlands."" This has resulted in over $1.1 billion worth of timber at risk and an increased threat of wildfire in this area. H.R. 1904 will address most of the forest health issues in Missouri and prioritize them for expedited cleanup. Section 102(a)(4) of this health forest legislation will specifically address this problem of red oak stem bore and oak decline. The first of Missouris two fire seasons is now underway. The most recent high wildfire season in Missouri occurred in 2000 when over 8.700 acres of wooded lands burnedmore than 3.000 acres over the 10year average. By expediting the cleanup or thinning of our forests. Missouri and tile rest of the Nation can expect to see the risk of these catastrophic wildfires reduced. In closing. I believe that H.R. 1904 represents a commonsense approach to forest management based on sound science. I have talked with forest scientists all over the country. including several from my own State. and they believe that this legislation takes the right approach to restoring the health of our Nations forests. These are actual forest scientists who know what they are talking aboutnot big city newspaper editorial writers. If we do not act on this problem right now. vast acres of old growth trees and wildlife habitat will remain at a high risk of catastrophic wildfire. Once these areas are destroyed by fire. there will be very little. if anything. that we can do to restore them to health. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1904. the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. It is time to put some common sense back into forest management. It is long past time that we get this done. I really thank the bipartisan group that came together for this extremely important and most needed forest health measure. Again. I urge my colleagues to support it and move it expeditiously.",115,115_forest_forests_timber_fires,"['forest', 'forests', 'timber', 'fires', 'trees', 'wildfire', 'fire', 'wildfires', 'thinning', 'logging']",forest - forests - timber - fires - trees - wildfire - fire - wildfires - thinning - logging,1,TRUE,1080096848

199325,Mr. President. I am pleased to bring before the Senate the Interior and related agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. In dollar terms. this is a modest bill compared to many of the appropriations bills we tackle in this body. It totals about $19.6 billion in discretionary budget authority. But in terms of its direct impact on the lives and livelihoods of the people and communities throughout this country. it is a critical bill. and it is of particular importance to the Western States. such as my State of Montana. where the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service either own or manage in trust vast acres of land. These are lands where my constituents live. This is where they graze livestock. where they mine. where they hike. hunt. fish. and timber. What we do in this bill affects all of those activities. It is not just a public lands bill. It is also a bill that provides education. health care. and other core services for the Native Americans of America. It supports energy research and development that fosters economic growth. strengthens our national security posture. and improves the quality of our environment. And it supports the treasured cultural institutions. such as the Smithsonian and the National Endowment for the Humanities- institutions that help tell the story of America and that remind us who we are as a people. As I suspect is the case with many of my colleagues who have chaired appropriations subcommittees. the more I learn about the agencies funded in this bill. the harder it gets to make tough choices that have to be made. particularly in the current fiscal climate. The Presidents fiscal year 2004 budget request for the Interior bill was $19.56 billion in discretionary budget authority. a modest increase over the comparable level for fiscal year 2003. While the budget request included increases for several activities that have considerable merit. it also proposed severe reductions in a number of critical programs that have broad support within the Senate. With an allocation that is effectively the same as the Presidents request. we had to make some tough choices. That said. with the help of Senator DORGAN. my good friend and neighbor from North Dakota. we have been able to fashion a responsible bill that does a number of very positive things. The bill provides increases for the core operating programs of the land management agencies. including $72 million for our National Park System and $31 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service. The funds provided for the park system include $20 million over the budget request to increase the base operating budgets of individual parks. The bill also increases funding for Bureau of Land Management operations by $27 million and adds $34 million to the Presidents request for Forest Service activities. From the Land and Water Conservation Fund. the bill appropriates $511 million. This includes $222 million for Federal land acquisition. an increase of $35 million over the budget request and more than double the House total of $100 million. As is always the case. there was great interest in increasing iunding for the land. water. and conservation programs. but I think the amount provided is reasonable given the constraints of the subcommittee allocation and the many other demands on this bill. The Interior bill also supports several grant programs. I wont go through all the numbers. but among the highlights is a $30 million increase over the budget request for payments in lieu of taxes. a $15 million increase for State wildlife grants. and an increase of $9 million for the Historic Preservation Fund. The bill also restores a proposed $16 million cut in the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund. Let me explain PILT. payment In lieu of taxes. This is tie money that goes directly to the counties to support their activities where a large amount of Federal land is found- BLM land. anyway. As I mentioned previously. the Interior bill is a vitally important bill for Native American communities. It increases funding for the Indian Health Service by $88 million over the enacted level. for a total of $2.9 billion. It includes $574 million for Indian education programs which fully funds the budget request for Indian school replacement. It also provides an Increase of $6 million for tribal community colleges. This is a subject that is of particular interest to both Senator DORGAN and me and one we may discuss further as we progress with tilts legislation. The bill also provides $243 million for the Office of Special Trustee to continue tile administration efforts to improve the management of Indian trust assets. This Is an increase of $95 million over the enacted level. While I strongly believe Congress must support trust reform. let there be no mistake that reform is coming at a very significant cost in terms of money. personnel. and management focus. Vital concerns In Indian country are being shortchanged because trust reform and related litigation are draining both funds and morale. We would all like there to be a simple solution. but there just isnt one. Settling the case may ultimately be the answer. but at this stage. the plaintiffs and the administration do not appear ready to have productive negotiations. Even If we settle on any past damages. the question remains as to how we manage Indian trust assets In the future. Tilts bill continues to support tile Departments reform efforts to tile greatest extent possible. I will continue to work closely with the Department. with the authorizing committees. and with Indian country to advance the reform effort so we can get ourselves out from under this Immense cloud. The Interior bill also supports an Important piece of our Nations energy portfolio. including research on fossil energy and energy efficiency. the operation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This bill provides $1.67 billion for Department of Energy programs. including $862 million for energy conservation and $594 million for fossil energy research and development. Among the cultural programs supported by this bill. the Smithsonian will receive an additional $10 million to prepare for the opening of two new museums. the Air and Space Museum extension near Dulles Airport. and the National Museum of the American Indian on The Mall. The National Endowment of the Arts will get $117 million and the National Endowment for the Humanities will get $142 million. This is an Increase of $15 million for the NEH. for an American history Initiative. This has been something the new Member of this body. Senator ALEXANDER from Tennessee. has worked on very hard ever since his arrival in the Senate and something he and I have discussed many times. I know Senator ALEXANDER and his staff have been meeting with administration officials and the authorizing committees to discuss ways of aligning the administrations American history proposal with his own. It Is my understanding those discussions are going well. Certainly we should all be pulling in the same direction on an issue such as this. I am excited about this Initiative. and I want to applaud our good friend from Tennessee for his hard work. Finally. I want to talk about funding of wildland fire management. This is a subject we find ourselves discussing again and again. The reason is this: The current system we have for tile fire suppression budgeting is broken. Again and again we find ourselves in a situation where both the Forest Service and the Department of Interior are forced to borrow massive amounts of money from other budget accounts to fight the fires. Those accounts are inside their own agencies. Tilts Is a reasonable mechanism when the amounts being borrowed are relatively modest. when the borrowing occurs only during particularly bad fire years. and when sufficient surplus carryover funds are readily available. But the borrowing has become routine and the amounts involved are massive. We no longer have large carryover amounts in other accounts. Tills carryover has disappeared In many accounts with the decline of the timber program and the revenues It produced. Last year. we borrowed heavily from a number of Forest Service and Interior accounts. causing both agencies to stop conducting certain activities until those amounts were repaid or replaced. In the end. however. we only repaid about 60 cents of every dollar borrowed. which Is the amount proposed by the administration in Its supplemental request. As a result of tills shortfall. a large number of congressionally approved projects have either been cancelled or reduced in scope. This year we find ourselves in the same situation. Prior to tile recess. my colleagues may recall I was very upset that the House sent us a supplemental appropriations bill that did not include the fire funds requested by the administration. Those funds were desperately needed in August when my State of Montana was suffering from dozens of significant fires. The presence of smoke was almost constant during the time I spent in Montana over the recess. In fact. two airports had to be closed for a period of time because of smoke. In a way. I am glad we did not act then. I say this because the $289 million that is under discussion in tile legislative branch appropriations bill is totally inadequate. I would not want anybody to believe that this amount begins to take care of our problem. The Department of Interior has already borrowed $130 million from other accounts to fight fires this summer. It expects to borrow $30 million more before the end of the fiscal year. The Forest Service has already borrowed- and get this figure- $595 million and is contemplating another $100 million transferred to get us through this fiscal year. Roughly speaking. we will borrow $850 million from other accounts before the end of the fiscal year. Simply providing the $289 million in tile pending administration request does not do the trick. These funds. for the most part. have already been spent. There are not options at this point. We need to repay those accounts soon and we need to repay them in full. Sixty cents on the dollar this time around would be devastating to a wide variety of programs. They range from endangered species monitoring to facilities construction. from acquisition to processing even the simplest forms of grazing permits. It would amount to a de facto rescission of funds that this Congress voted to appropriate when It approved the 2003 bill. My colleagues will hear more from me later on this Issue. and I will likely have an amendment to offer at some point. but for now I want to use this opportunity to tell my colleagues this is not just a problem for those States where there has been fire. It Is a problem for every State in this country. because the funds are effectively borrowed from every State. Including the projects and programs that were funded at a specific request of Members in this body. So I call on the administration to send up another supplemental request. one that fully reflects the amounts that will be spent on fire suppression this fiscal year. I thank my friend. Senator DORGAN. and his staff. They have been great to work with. Of course. we conic from almost tile same part of the country- in fact. we are neighbors- so it was very easy for neighbors to get together and to roll up our sleeves and put this bill together. His input has been very valuable. We have tried to fashion a bill that reflects the priorities of the Senate as a whole. I think this bill does just that. So I urge my colleagues who have amendments to get them to me or to my staff as quickly as possible so we can deal with them and get this bill to conference. I caution. however. that we have allocated the entire amount of the subcommittees allocation. Any amendment that provides additional funds will have to be fully offset. and I think I can speak for Senator DORGAN in saying we will take a dim view of amendments that propose to use acrosstheboard reductions or unspecified administrative savings as offsets. I ask tile support of this Senate for this bill. I would hope we can have this bill done by tomorrow. and move on and get this bill into conference. I urge my colleagues to support it. If I can get the attention of my good friend from North Dakota. I look forward to working with him on this issue and I appreciate his good help and his input on this bill. I yield the floor to my good friend from North Dakota.,4148,4148_interior_cara_nrra_conservation,"['interior', 'cara', 'nrra', 'conservation', 'forest', 'mop', 'humanities', 'parks', 'wildlife', 'riders']",interior - cara - nrra - conservation - forest - mop - humanities - parks - wildlife - riders,1,TRUE,1080082099

236303,"Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H.R. 2264. the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act of 2003. Having personally visited some of the areas that this bill will help to protect. I highly recommend it to the House. and hope that others will join in support of this effort. Secretary of State Colin Powell launched the Congo Basin Forest Partnership initiative that has swiftly grown into a bipartisan multinational effort to support national parks and wellmanaged forestry practices in the forests of the Congo Basin in Central Africa. The International Conservation Caucus. of which I am a founding member and cochair. was formed in order to build support for the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Initiative. and to help with other international conservation efforts in some of the most environmentally sensitive areas around the world. In the mission statement of the International Conservation Caucus. it Is written that as members we share a conviction that the United States has the opportunity and the obligation to advance the protection of the worldwide environment for current and future generations. The mission of the Caucus is to act on this conviction by providing the strong U.S. leadership necessary to conserve the worlds most biologically rich and diverse places. The Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act is one of the first steps in achieving our mission of international conservation. and I wish to thank my friend CLAY SHAW for recognizing this need and for Introducing this important bipartisan bill. The United States contribution to the CBFP will focus on providing fieldbased conservation activities within 25.000.000 acres in Cameroon. The Central African Republic. the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Equatorial Guinea. Gabon. and the Republic of the Congo. Forests in these six countries are being depleted at alarming rates. It is estimated that forest areas in the Congo Basin are being depleted at a rate twice the size of Rhode Island every year. The author of H.R. 2264 says it best in section 7 of the findings of the bill. It states. ""If current deforestation and wildlife depletion rates are not reversed. the six countries of the Congo Basin most immediately. but also the world. will pay an immense economic. environmental. and cultural price. Madam Speaker. I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2264. the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act.",6532,6532_congo_basin_2264_gabon,"['congo', 'basin', '2264', 'gabon', 'icca', 'partnership', 'conservation', 'africa', 'pack', 'forest']",congo - basin - 2264 - gabon - icca - partnership - conservation - africa - pack - forest,1,TRUE,1080088121

242509,Madam President. we have had a great deal of discussion about the fires raging throughout California this week. We talked about fire seasons In the past several years. The years 2000. 2002. and 2003 fire seasons have been some of the worst on record nationally. In 2002. in my State of Alaska alone. we experienced fires that burned over a million acres. Over a million acres in Alaska were burned in 2002. In this year. in 2003this Is from a report that is current as of yesterday. taking into account what is happening in California as we speakto date. approximately 3.6 million acres have burned nationwide3.6 million acres. and burning. Forest fires are a huge problem. predominantly in the West. for those of us in the Western States. It is interesting to look around the Chamber this afternoon and see how many of the Western State Senators are paying very close attention to the debate on this legislation. We know. we can see the damage to our forested lands from these catastrophic wildfires. many of which have resulted from forests that have been devastated by insects and by disease. Deteriorating forest and rangeland health now affects more than 190 million acres of public lands throughout the country. Again. as we have seen from the pictures which the Senators from California displayed and from the newspapers. the areas where the fires are ravaging the hillsides and destroying communities are areas that were affected by insects and disease. I want to take us to a picture of Alaska. as the good Senator from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENICI. mentioned not too long ago. In my State. our forests have been infected and literally torn -apart by a beetle known as the spruce bark beetle. The spruce bark beetle. other insects. and other diseases have devastated hundreds of thousands of acres along the Kenai Peninsula and in the Chugach Mountains. and outside of my hometown in Anchorage along the hillsides. You are talking about the wildlandurban interface communities and how it all plays out. I see that very carefully and very closely every time I am home. The picture that I have behind me is a picture from the Kenai Peninsula in the southern part of the State. This Is a picture of forests that have been totally wiped out by the spruce bark beetle. There is not a tree that you look at in the forefront or In the background that is alive. Every one of these trees are dead. They were killed by the spruce bark beetle. As the Senator from New Mexico mentioned. it is like a Christmas tree that you have put out on the back porch and it no longer has any water. The leaves are crumbly to the touch and fall when you touch them. These trees that you are looking at are probably 30 to 40 feet high. It is tough to estimate the girth of the trunk. But these are very mature oldgrowth trees that are standing waiting for an accident to happenwaiting for a fire. This is not tinder sitting on the forest floor. This is standing tinder that is just waiting to be devastated and to devastate potentially property and human life. As we look at this picture and understand the stands we are talking about here. I mentioned that there were hundreds of thousands of acres which have been devastated by insect and disease in Alaska. The spruce bark beetle has literally changed the forests in Alaska. Over 5 million acres of trees In southcentral and the interior of Alaska have been lost to the spruce bark beetle over just the past 10 years. This picture shows. I have been told. the result of trees that have been infested for about a 10year period. These were perfectly healthy. strong. and living trees. The entire forest has been wiped out by the spruce bark beetle. We are told in Alaska that this is one of the worst recorded incidents of beetle kill and infestation in our history. You do not see any homes. You do not see any development. This is out in the wilds of Alaska. if you will. But adjoining the Chugach National Forest. off of the Kenai Peninsula. we have many smaller communitiescertainly not a Los Angelestype of community but we have homes. We have towns that adjoin these national parklands. We have a little community called Moose Pass which sits right in the middle of dead and dying trees. My home city of Anchorage. the largest population center in the Stateabout half of the residents of the State of Alaska live in Anchorageis rimmed by the Chugach National Forest. We are dealing with the infestation of the spruce bark beetle as It is traveling north. The danger is made even worse when you couple it with the fact that we have had low snowfalls in recent years. Again. it is an accident almost waiting to happen. We dont want to happen in Alaska what we are currently seeing in California. Our public land laws and regulations should not make it difficult to cut down the dead or the dying trees that are nothing but potential fuel for these catastrophic wildfires. Our Nations policy has to allow for responsible forest management that includes the ability to remove. when appropriate. wildfire fuel from our forests. That is why I am supporting the bipartisan amendment to title I of H.R. 1904. In particular. there is a subsection which will authorize treatment under title I on Federal land. This technical change allows for hazardous fuels reduction on Federal lands on which wind throw or blown down ice storm damage or the existence of disease or insect infestation has occurred and poses a significant threat to an ecosystem component on Federal land or adjacent nonFederal land. I suggest to you. looking at this picture and understanding the extent of the insect infestation that we have. that it certainly poses a significant threat to an ecosystem component. The Kenai Peninsula National Forest System land contains approximately 223.000 forested acres of which 119.000 contain spruce trees with a percentage of old growth. These oldgrowth stands are susceptible to the spruce bark beetle or are already dead. The amendment we are speaking tothe bipartisan amendment under title Iwill allow Federal land managers to manage the dead and dying tree stands. The prespruce bark beetle epidemic condition on the Kenai Peninsula had a significant acreage in unmanaged oldgrowth spruce which was very susceptible to massive mortality and the buildup of the spruce bark beetle population. The key to longterm forest management on the Kenai Peninsula that will prevent a reoccurrence of the type of spruce bark beetle mortality is to manage the forested landscape for a variety of species compositions. structures. and age classesnot simply unmanaged oldgrowth stands. To maintain the watershed healthwhich we certainly needthe Chugach National Forest needs to manage the landscape on the Kenai Peninsula for a variety of species. structures. and age classes. With the technical change that we are seeing in this amendment. it allows for oldgrowth stands such as those existing on the Kenai Peninsula to be treated without restriction related to the oldgrowth provisions that are being offered in other sections of the amendment. I believe that with the legislation before usthe Healthy Forest Restoration Actwe have a comprehensive plan focused on giving the Federal land managers and their partners the tools they need to respond to national forest health crises. That is what we have in Alaska. That is what we are seeing in many parts of the West. This legislation directs the timely implementation of scientifically supported management activities to protect the health and vibrancy of Federal forest ecosystems as well as protecting the communities and the private lands that surround them. I support what we are doing with H.R. 1904 and certainly encourage Members support.,5892,5892_wildfires_fires_fire_spruce,"['wildfires', 'fires', 'fire', 'spruce', 'wildfire', 'burned', 'forest', 'beetle', 'burning', 'bark']",wildfires - fires - fire - spruce - wildfire - burned - forest - beetle - burning - bark,1,TRUE,1080096900

248181,Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. This bill. H.R. 2264. authorizes the administrations Congo Basin Forest Partnership. It is authored by the gentleman from Florida . who is an international conservation leader. I am a cosponsor of this measure. and I think the imrortance of It is that the tropical forests of central Africas Congo Basin are a key economic resource for an estimated 20 million people. and these forests play a very critical role in sustaining the environment. The Congo Basin contains the most diverse grouping of plants and animals in all of Africa. including many rare and endangered species. These plants and animals are invaluable for so many reasons. including their genetic and biological information which could spark technical advances in medicine and agriculture. This is all threatened. though. as Congo Basin forests are coming under growing pressure. Ten years ago. these forests were virtually untouched. Today. logging operations are shrinking these forests. As a matter of fact. logging operations are taking out the Congo Basin forest at the rate of twice the size of Rhode Island every year. Meanwhile. the construction of logging roads is putting intense hunting pressure on wildlife. At current levels. because of poaching. most species of apes. large antelope. and elephants will disappear from the Congo Basin. as well as the white rhino. and some will become extinct. Last September. Secretary of State Powell launched the Congo Basin Forest Partnership in Johannesburg. This partnership is focused on 11 key landscapes in 6 different countries. It aims to support a network of national parks and protected areas and wellmanaged forestry concessions. The partnership is working to combat illegal logging and illegal poaching and other unsustainable practices and to give local populations an economic stake in the preservation of the forests. including through the development of ecotourism. This is a true partnership. with European and other countries making financial contributions to it. I should note that the most dramatic move toward conserving Congo Basin forests has been taken by Gabon. Last year. President Omar Bongo announced the creation of 13 separate national parks in his country. Previously. Gabon had no national parks system. With this partnership. there is a real African buyin. The Subcommittee on Africa that I chair held a hearing on this initiative in March. Testifying before us was worldrenowned ecologist Michael Fay. Michael has traveled many of Africas forests. especially in the Congo Basin. and has had several of his treks covered by National Geographic. I am pleased that the House is acting today to pass this bill. It supports conservation efforts by him and others which have come. in Michaels case. at great personal sacrifice. Conservation is not easy. What Americans take for granted. Yosemite. Yellowstone and our magnificent national park system. took great foresight. It took a great political commitment to make that a reality. We led the world in the United States. It will be a major challenge to establish and maintain effective regimes to control logging and to control hunting in the Congo Basin. but with the partnership. the U.S. is bringing its unique experience and talents to these efforts. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.,6532,6532_congo_basin_2264_gabon,"['congo', 'basin', '2264', 'gabon', 'icca', 'partnership', 'conservation', 'africa', 'pack', 'forest']",congo - basin - 2264 - gabon - icca - partnership - conservation - africa - pack - forest,1,TRUE,1080088113

252557,Madam President. today I rise to recognize one -of our most prominent Wisconsinites. Gaylord Nelson. the founder of Earth Day. the man who fundamentally changed the way American people view the environment. Before Gaylord Nelson came along. pollution and ecology were fringe subjects. a concern of only a few academics. After Gaylord Nelson created Earth Day in 1970. environmental issues exploded into our public debate. In that first year. almost 20 million people participated in Earth Day eventsan instant success. By last year. 500 million people in 167 countries took part in Earth Day. .spreading the message of environmental stewardship. Earth Day laid the foundation for landmark environmental legislation. All over the country. Americans heard about the dangers of lead in our water. pesticides in our drinking water. and chemicals in our soil. An informed public brought pressure on Congress and the President to act. The movement that started that first Earth Day led to the Clean Air Act. the Clean Water Act. the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. and Superfund legislation. These are the foundations of environmental law today. and they would not have been possible without the work and the vision of Senator Gaylord Nelson. That vision is still.necessary today as we struggle to complete the work Gaylord Nelson started in 1970. Congress and the administration still must address arsenic in the water. mercury in the air. and the impact of outdated coalburning powerplants. just to name a few outstanding. environmental problems. Gaylord Nelsons dream is not yet a reality. but it is worth fighting for. as is so much Gaylord Nelson has championed. Senator NELSON entered public service in 1948 after serving 4 years in the military during World War II. He served as a Wisconsin State senator. Governor. and then as a U.S. Senator for 18 years. As Governor. he was known for conservation efforts and preserving wetlands long before those causes became popular nationally. As a Senator. he built on his environmental reputation to further issues. including the preservation of the Appalachian Trail corridor and the creation of a national trail system. While he left .the Government in 1981. Gaylord Nelson never stopped fighting for the environment. He joined the Wilderness Society where he has worked tirelessly ever since. Even today at age 87. he is an active advocate for fragile lands around the country. This year. Earth*Day is a reminder of how much progress we have made and how much further we have yet to go. In the 1970s. the symbol of environmental decay was the burning Cuyahoga River. a waterway turned into a drainage ditch for industry. While Cleveland suffered much ridicule for that ecological disaster. they were not alone. At that time. our natural resources were being squandered and scarred in community after community. Today such obvious examples of irresponsibility are harder to find. Now we struggle with pollution that is more diffuse and harder to track. but still dangerous. In Wisconsin. our northern lakes contain so much mercury the fish caught there are often unsafe to eat. And in the southeastern part of my State. the air is contaminated with pollutants. many of which traveled hundreds of miles before impacting our environment. Challenges such as these require everyone in the region. the country. and even the world to work together to lower emissions and limit discharge. Global connectedness was vhat the original Earth Day was all about. and that message still needs to be heard today. Gaylord Nelson wanted us all to realize we could not escape the consequences of pollution by burying our garbage somewhere else or sending it up ever taller smokestacks.. Earth Day also reminds us we need to work internationally. We need to engage developing economies. such as China. India. and Russia. to head off major environmental disasters. We are not on this planet alone. and we can no longer pretend environmental damage around the globe does not come back to haunt us here at home. SenatorNelson understood that lesson almost 40 years ago. and he has been teaching it to the rest of us ever since. We have made progress in heeding Gaylord Nelsons call to action over the last 34 years. Water quality is better off than it was in 1970. Many dangerous toxins are off the market. and some large environmental disasters of the past are clean today. But we certainly are not ready to declare we do not need Earth Day anymore. and we are not ready to let Gaylord Nelson retire. We are more aware today. of the global and longterm impact our actions have on our Earth. and with that greater awareness comes a greater responsibility to leave the planet cleaner and healthier. Earth Day is an opportunity for Members of Congress to recommit ourselves to that goal. and Earth Day is a day to thank Gaylord Nelson for focusing us on how we impact the environment that sustains us and the legacy we owe to the generations that follow US. Thank you. Madam President.

259250,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to announce that I am joined by TOM LANTOS and 28 of our colleagues in introducing a bill to reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA) through FY 2007. This bipartisan conservation incentive program helps to protect the worlds most valuable tropical forests through ""debtfornature"" mechanisms. This bipartisan reauthorization we are introducing today was developed with the Bush Administration. the Nature Conservancy. the World Wildlife Fund. Conservation International. and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The Administration and these highly respected environmental organizations are to be commended for all of their excellent work on the TFCA and this bill. In the 105th Congress I. along with our former colleagues Lee Hamilton and John Kasich. introduced the legislation that established the TFCA. It was overwhelmingly approved and enacted in 1998. The TFCA was reauthorized in 2001 through the end of this year. The TFCA is based on the previous Bush Administrations Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) that allows the President to restructure debt in exchange for conservation efforts in Latin America. The TFCA expands on the EAI and allows protection of threatened tropical forests worldwide. A conservative estimate of 39.5 million acres of tropical forests will be protected by TFCA agreements since its enactment in 1998. The United States has a sIgnificant national interest in protecting tropical forests in developing countries. Tropical forests provide a wide range of benefits. They harbor 5090 percent of the earths terrestrial biodiversity. They act as ""carbon sinks."" absorbing massive quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. thereby reducing greenhouse gases. They regulate rainfall on which agriculture and coastal resources depend. and they are of great importance to regional and global climate. Furthermore. tropical forests are breeding grounds for new medicines. Twentyfive percent of prescription drugs come from tropical forests. The United States National Cancer Institute has identified over 3000 plants that are active against cancer. Seventy percent of them can be found in rainforests. Regrettably. tropical forests are rapidly disappearing. It is estimated that 30 million acres (an area larger than the State of Pennsylvania) are lost each year. The heavy debt burden of many countries is a contributing factor because they must resort to exploitation of their natural resources (particularly the extraction of timber. oil. and precious metals) to generate revenue to service their external debt. At the same time. poor governments tend to have few resources available to set aside and protect tropical forests. The TFCA addresses these economic pressures by authorizing the President to allow eligible countries to engage in debt swaps. buybacks or reductionrestructuring in exchange for protecting threatened tropical forests on a sustained basis. The debt for nature mechanisms in the TFCA have proven to be an effective. marketoriented means to leverage scarce funds available for international conservation. The host country places an amount in its tropical forest fund that typically exceeds the cost to the U.S. government of the debt reduction agreement. Furthermore. because these tropical forest funds have integrity and are broadly supported within the host country. conservation organizations are interested in placing their own money in these tropical forest funds producing additional leverage of Federal conservation dollars. Seven TFCA agreements have been concluded to date: Bangladesh. El Salvador. Belize. Peru. the Philippines. Panama and Colombia. These agreements have generated more than .$70 million in tongterm income commitments for tropical forest conservation. Private donors have contributed more than $5 million to TFCA swaps. leveraging the U.S. government funds. Active deals are currently being negotiated with Jamaica and Sri Lanka. Several other countries have expressed interest in the program including Guatemala. Ecuador. Paraguay. St. Vincent. Botswana. Costa Rica. the Dominican Republic. India. Indonesia. Brazil. and Kenya. This bill will improve the TFCA and reauthorize it at $20 million in FY 2005. which is included in the Presidents budget request. $25 million in FY 2006. and $30 million in FY The Tropical Forest Conservation Act is an excellent program that is working well and worthy of reauthorization. I urge all members to support this important. marketoriented approach to conserving the worlds most threatened tropical forests.",6159,6159_tropical_tfca_forests_forest,"['tropical', 'tfca', 'forests', 'forest', 'eai', 'conservation', 'gabon', 'bangladesh', '4654', 'swaps']",tropical - tfca - forests - forest - eai - conservation - gabon - bangladesh - 4654 - swaps,1,TRUE,1080164798

274261,"Mr. President. I appreciate the opportunity to. take some time in morning business to talk about one of the things that impacts us all. that we all see as we come to work each day or whatever we do in our day. and that is the cost of energy. particularly gasoline. It has an impact on all of us. certainly. something that affects not only you and me in our cars trying to get to work. but also the cost of other services and merchandise we buy. because- there is an additional cost to development of all those things when gas is as high as it is right now. It is a difficult thing to deal with because it is an item that over time we have expanded in our use. and we have begun to use a good deal more than we have in the past. We have increased our consumption. but we have not done the same thing with the kind of support facilities necessary to meet those increased demands. Again. one of the issues is not only gas or electricity. but it is the whole issue of energy in a broad sense. certainly. and energy policy that has to do with the longterm availability of energy to meet the demands we have. Again. I point to the fact we have not been able to move an energy policy in the Senate in order to deal with the future. We will hear a lot of complaints. probably today. about something that ought to be done. The real important thing is. we ought to do something about the policy so over time we can make some of the changes that need to be made to change the whole situation with energy over time. Obviously. there are a number of activities that need to be done. A lot of factors affect fuel price and supply. One of them. obviously. is the cost of oil. Crude oil is at historic highs right now. In the past. we were accustomed to seeing crude oil at about $22 a barrel. We talk about it when we make plans. It is now nearly $41. It has increased agreat deal over the last several months. It is very important to understand that the cost of oil represents almost 50 percent of the cost of gas at the pump. There are other costs. of course. but this is the major cost. Interestingly enough. the cost of crude oil. plus the taxes. represents a little over 70 percent of the cost of gasoline. So when we. talk about these costs. of course. that has to be one of the factors. Also. there are less refined gasoline imports. as gas. not as oil. because of sulfur regulations. Over the years. we have had a reduction in the number of refineries. It seems strange. doesnt it. as demand has gone up substantially. the number of refineries has gone down. It is true that capacity has not changed that much because the refineries have gotten larger. but they have not increased the capacity over time. In the late eighties. we were using about 85 percent of capacity of refineries. Now it is about 94 percent of capacity being used. and the demand. of course. has gone up over- that time. There has been a continual closure of refineries over the last 23 years. and so the system is now very tight. In addition to capacity. we have had a lot of different regulations and different kinds of additions to gasoline in different parts of the country so that refining has been made much more expensive and much more difficult to market in that they have to have this kind of reduction here and another one for this State and so on. It has been very difficult. The reality is that there are a number of components to the price of gasoline. We have to review those in context. We will be hearing probably soon that the Government ought to be taking oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. which is there to be a reserve and has been put together over a period of time. The fact is that the daily input into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is about 170.000 barrels a day. and the consumption in this country is almost 9 million barrels a day. It is a relatively small amount. There may be some merit in diverting the daily input into this reserve. but I certainly think it would not make a lot of sense to extract from it. It will be interesting to see what happens with respect to this issue. The fact is that the current price. when adjusted for GDP or growth in the economy and inflation. is not at a record high. In the 1980s. as a matter of fact. given the same economics. the price of gas was higher than it is today. However. since it has gone up from $1.50 to $2. that is a sudden impact. The 1981 price. if it is measured against todays economy. would be over $3. We have to be realistic about where we are. The most significant factor. of course. that affects gasoline prices is the cost of crude oil. As I mentioned. it represents almost 50 percent of the cost of a finished gallon of gasoline. Crude oil prices have increased about 60 percent since April a year ago. That is a great increase. The other point is that we have become more dependent on imported crude oil as opposed to domestic production. We have. interestingly enough. less control over that production. The high demand in Asia and the U.S.. plus OPEC activities. has restrained production over the years. It is the most important factor affecting prices. Another key factor is increased gasoline demand. and that continues to go up. We can see that each day on the street in the number of cars and SUVs that are using more gasoline per mile than they did in the past. It is interesting. as we are moving in one direction in use and consumption. we are moving in another direction in providing the supply. We have had a crazy arrangement. We have had very little growth in the U.S. in refining capacity. Currently. there are 149 refineries with a capacity of 16.8 million barrels a day. In 1980. there were 321 refineries with a capacity of 18.6 million barrels per day. That has been a conflict in our situation. Of course. there are a number of reasons for that situation. There have been no new refineries built since 1976. and unlikely due. of course. to political considerations. including siting costs. environmental requirements. industrial profitability. and. most importantly. the ""not in my backyard"" attitude which we seem to see in energy. We have over here demand and consumption. we want this service. but. over here we say:. Oh. yes. but we do not want refineries in our midst. we do not want transmission lines. we do not Want the- things that are elements of energy. but at the same time we want more of the product. These are some of the problems. They are not easy to resolve. but they are. resolvable. We need to take a look at a policy for the future and begin to provide incentives to do what needs to be done. to take another look at some of the environmental controls we have put in place. That is not to say we do not want to protect the environment. but there are ways to do it that are less intrusive on production. There is no doubt that environmental regulations have played a part in increasing the cost of fuel. No one believes we ought to sacrifice the environment. That is not the issue. The question is how can we do it in a more environmentally secure way without putting limitations on production. The environmental and energy policies are interlinked. We must remember. when we are considering new regulations and policies. what impact it is going to have on the result. We do not seem -to consider those two issues at the same time. We put on regulations saying we are going to help the environment. not thinking about what impact it has. Now we are at the point where the impact is affecting us. and we say: My gosh. what have we done? What happened here? Why do we have these increased costs? It is pretty clear we need to do some things that are different from what we have done in the past. It is fair to say that many of the folks from the Northeast and California complain. about the high prices. however. their delegations over time have supported unilateral disarmament of our energy security by refusing to accept the balance that has to be created. They have opposed offshore drilling. coalfired plants. nuclearfired plants. the development of ANWR. leasing and development of minerals on public lands. and hydro relicensingjust a few of the things that have to do with domestic production and transportation of energy. I guess we have to ask. Where do they think energy fuel comes from? It does not come out of the sky. We have to produce it. It iskind of like that attitude that one thinks milk and eggs just come from Safeway. There are some animals behind it. We have to consider the consequences when the Federal Government mandates a certain environmental equation such as a 2percent oxygenate that is put into gas. We have to be sensitive and realize the consequences so that the decisions we make with regard to those issues have to be balanced with what we need. I hear all of this complaining about it but then we do not seem to recognize the link between Federal regulations and the higher price of gas: the phaseout of MTBE.. the tier II gasoline sulfur standards. diesel standards. regional haze. All of these Clean Air Act requirements are going to raise the price of gasoline. There are some things we can do. We have to do something about conservation. We have to find ways that we can use energy more efficiently. and that is possible. It is starting to happen even in automobiles. I come from a State where SUVs are necessary. Sometimes we need a fourwheel drive to get to my house. Where I stay in northern Virginia. pickups and SUVs arb all over the place. I do not think they need fourwheel drives very often. but that is fine. We can still make those more efficient. We can take a look at it. We have to do some things over time to fuel cars with other thingshydrogen. for example. In our energy policy we have the opportunity to take a look at more research and more opportunities to provide alternatives. Gas and oil are not going to be there forever at the same degree they are now. They will be for a good long time if we treat them properly. but there comes a time when we have to look at other kinds of things. and that is what this policy is about. That is why we need to be looking at more than just next week or next year. We have to take a look at what we are going to be doing. We have to modernize our energy structure to make it more efficient than it is now. We have to talk about renewables. whether it be electricity. wind energy. or Sun energy. These are things we need ta be doing. We know how to do them in small amounts now. but we have to find out how to do them in volume. We have to find out how to do them in a reasonable and bearable cost. but we can do that if we focus on doing it. At the same time. we can protect the environment. My home State is one of the States where we have a great deal of energy production. We are the No. 1 producer of coal. for example. Well. in order to do that. we have to change thifigs somewhat. We have to do some more research to find out how we can have clean burning coal. because it is the largest fossil fuel available to us. We also are a producer of oil and gas. We have natural gas. of course. which has many uses as energy but we ought to be using coal or nuclear for the electric generation because natural gas is much more fluid.. It can be used in other ways and for many other things. where coal cannot. The point I am trying to make is that these are things that are out there in the future but they will not come about until we decide we are going to emphasize a policy with regard to energy and the impact it will have on us over the years. The bill that we have is available to do these things. Unfortunately. we have had some problems of obstruction in getting it done. We need to work on that and acknowledge where w are and where our consumption is. Right -now. it is reaching beyond where we are in terms of having a product to provide. So it seems to ine it is pretty clear that is the direction we need to move and it is the direction we can. indeed. move. We have a greater opportunity to do that now. I will now take a second to look at some of the highlights of the energy policy bill that we do have. As far as oil and gas. we permanently authorized the Strategic Reserve. We have incentives for producing from marginal -wells. As my colleagues can imagine. when wells produce a great deal of product each day everyone is interested in that. When they become marginal. there needs to be some incentives to continue to do that. We have some royalty relief for deep water wells and for our greatest opportunity for these products offshore. We need to take into account the enivironmental status that we want there. We have to do something about a gas pipeline from Alaska where some of our greatest reserves of energy are. I already mentioned clean coal and certainly there are opportunities for us to ensure that the largest resource. fossil fuel. is available without being harsh on the environment. Indian energy. we have not allowed the tribes to be doing something on the reservations. which many of them would like to do. A lot of people resist nuclear energy. The fact is. we want clean generated electricity. Nuclear is probably the best opportunity that we have to do that. The section is also there on renewables so. again. we can make some progress in terms of being able to utilize some renewable energy sources that will take some of the pressure off of the kind of production that we have now. We have a great challenge. I think it is a challenge to this body to move forward on an energy policy and stop finding reasons to not have one and object to having. one. It is the same people who complain about not having affordable energy. and that is kind of where we are. We can indeed change that.

275177,Mr. Chairman. I rise today to express my support for H.R. 4818. the FY 2005 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. and I want to commend Chairman KOLBE and Ranking Member LOWEY for including $20 million for the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. This is the amount requested by President Bush in his FY 2005 Budget submission. The TFCA is based on the previous Bush administrations Enterprise for Americas Initiative. and authorizes the President to restructure debt in exchange for conservation of threatened tropical forests worldwide. Tropical forests are important. They absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to help reduce greenhouse gases. They help regulate rainfall on which agriculture and coastal resources depend. and their plants are a vital source of new medicines. including treatments for cancer. Regrettably. about 30 million acres of tropical forests (an area larger than the State of Pennsylvania) are lost each year because many countries are forced to exploit timber and other natural resources to generate revenue to pay their external debt. Seven TFCA agreements have been concluded to date: Bangladesh. El Salvador. Belize. Peru. the Philippines. Panama and Colombia. These agreements have generated more than $70 million in longterm income tropical forest conservation and will contribute to the conservation of 40 million acres of tropical forests. Private donors have contributed more than $5 million to TFCA swaps. leveraging the U.S. government funds. Active deals are currently being negotiated with Jamaica and Sri Lanka. Several other countries that have expressed interest or are eligible for TFCA. On June 24th. The International Relations Committee unanimous approved H.R. 4654. a bipartisan bill I introduced with our colleague. TOM LANTOS. and 32 other cosponsors to reauthorize TFCA through FY 2007. That bill was developed with the Bush administration. the Nature Conservancy. the World Wildlife Fund. Conservation International and the Wildlife Conservation Society. We expect H.R. 4654 to come to the floor in the near future. TFCA is a worthy program that is working well. The Bush Administration is a strong proponent of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. and it has bipartisan support in the Congress. I again thank the leadership for providing the funding in H.R. 4818 so TFCA can continue to protect some of the worlds most threatened natural resources.,6159,6159_tropical_tfca_forests_forest,"['tropical', 'tfca', 'forests', 'forest', 'eai', 'conservation', 'gabon', 'bangladesh', '4654', 'swaps']",tropical - tfca - forests - forest - eai - conservation - gabon - bangladesh - 4654 - swaps,1,TRUE,1080171664
276017,"Madam President. this amendment addresses one of the most serious security threats facing our Nation: the threat of a terrorist attack on a chemical facility. As in my State. the great State of North Carolina has had some accidents with regard to chemical plants recently. and many people believe it is one of the greatest vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. I have discussed this issue many times. as it is vital to my State. which has a heavy concentration of chemical plant facilities. There are thousands of these facilities across the Nation that can release and expose tens of thousands of Americans to highly toxic gasessome fatal. some leading to great illness. It should not be lost on the American public that we will be remembering the 20th anniversary of Bhopal this year where as many as 7.000 people have ultimately passed from a chemical plant explosion. It was tragic at the time. There are many other instances. and there is a great risk associated with these plants. The reality is that many of them were built at an earlier time in our economy where now there are surrounding densely populated areas. That is why this has been a great concern to people who think about homeland security right in our neighborhoods. It is the reason we need to make sure that what could be attractive targets for terrorists are properly addressed in the Homeland Security appropriations process. Unfortunately. there are currently no Federal standards for chemical facilities. The private sector has been left to do whatever it chooses completely on a voluntary basis. I believe there are many chemical facilities where people have done a good job. It is in their selfinterest to protect their employees. themselves. their proprietary interests. and they have done a good job. But that does not mean that all facilities have. Quite frankly. since there are no standards and no accountability requirements. we dont know. We are vulnerable. at least according to all of the experts who review homeland security. We are putting at risk literally millions of Americans. It is an unacceptable risk. from my standpoint. According to EPA. there are 123 facilities in 24 States where a chemical release could expose more than 1 million people to highly toxic chemicals. We have a chart showing where about 100.000 Americans are at risk. But there are 123. 8 of which are in my State. where 1 million people could be exposed to toxic chemicals. There are about 750 facilities in 39 States where a chemical release could expose more than 100.000 people. and there are nearly 3.000 facilities spread across 49 States where a chemical release could expose more than 10.000 people to toxic chemicals. It is a broad problem around the Nation. It is acknowledged. I have discussed many times this issue in the Senate Chamber. on the Environment and Public Works Committee. It needs to be addressed. I dont think we ought to be discussing this after there is a problem. we ought to be talking about it and correcting the issue ahead of time. There are no standards. The numbers are pretty staggering. There are others who might define exposure somewhat differently. I noticed recently the Department of Homeland Security. instead of looking at a 360degree circumference around a chemical plant. has tried to talk about the prevailing wind patterns in an area and lower the numbers. But we are still talking about literally millions of Americans being exposed to the possibility of toxic air masses coming out of one of these plants. It is time to act. It is not enough to just use words and talk about voluntary standards. Frankly. there is ongoing work in the EPW Committee to come up with a compromise proposal. I am supportive of the idea that we want to move forward. This security issue is real and present and needs to be dealt with. In fact. the Department of Justice. a year and a half before September 11. issued a report on April 16. 2000. about chemical plants. That was mentioned in the HartRudman report. In almost every situation that someone speaks to homeland security. chemical plants show up in the discussion. But the Justice Department writes in the April 18. 2000. report: We have concluded the risk of terrorists attempting in the foreseeable future to cause an industrial chemical release is both real and credible . . . Increasingly. terrorists engineer their attacks to cause mass casualties to the populace andor largescale damage to property. Terrorists or other criminals are likely to view the potential of a chemical release from an industrial facility as a relatively attractive means of achieving these goals. It couldnt be stated more clearly. And that was before September 11. If we thought there were risks then. we have to believe there are risks now. That report should have awakened us. We have comments after September 11 from people who are importantly involved in our homeland security efforts. For example. in congressional testimony. Governor Ridge said: The fact is. we have a very diversified economy and our enemies look at some of our economic assets as targets. And clearly. the chemical facilities are one of them. We know that there have been reports validated about security deficiencies at dozens and dozens of [plants]. Let me tell you about some of the reports to which Governor Ridge may have been referring. The Pittsburgh TribuneReview conducted a major investigation about chemical plant security across the countryPennsylvania. Houston. Chicago. New Jersey. elsewhere. They found that intruders had unfettered access to some of the Nations deadliest stockpiles of toxins and explosives. Security was so lax that in broad daylight a reporter could easily walk up to tanks. pipes. and control rooms. If there is any intellectual integrity in these reports. this is absolute proof that we have inconsistency. at best. with regard to implementation of security requirements or security arrangements at a lot of our chemical plants. I am not just relying on press reports. In fact. I have visited chemical facilities myself. seen lax security. some in my own State. The fact is. we have to move on this. I visited one plant in New Jersey that had gaping holes in the security fence. Along with a reporter from CBS 60 Minutes. I walked right onto a plant. This is one that was a member of the society that is espousing voluntary standards. While it was not all that much fun moving into one of these plants. it was easy to have accomplished. Had we been terrorists with just a small explosive device. we could have easily caused a tragic and truly catastrophic release of toxic chemicals. It is uncertain about what the loss of life would be. but it happened to be another plant in New Jersey that is located right under a freeway. with no guards or anything to keep somebody from pulling up. faking a flat tire. and tossing a hand grenade over the side wall of an overpass into a chemical plant facility. It is actually one of the largest exposures of the various plants in America. And. again. it was a plant that was a member of the Chemical Society. which talks about standards. This is something which I think we need to recognize. that it is not always the highest common denominator we have to work with. We have to worry about the exposures at the lowest common denominator. It is a real threat and problem. We need to address that. Let me add that I have not come down to bash the chemical industry. because I dont believe this is representative of everyone in the industry. Many are doing everything the standards ask and call for. We need to assure the American people we are doing that everywhere. We would not accept that we have OK security at one nuclear powerplant but not at another. We have standards and accountability applying to those situations because it is a risk to the people in and around those communities. We demand 100percent attention to detail. These plants can be as deadly and as negative for the communities they. are in as anywhere else. We need to make sure everyone is acting in good faithnot only the good actors but everyone. That is why I feel so strongly that we need to move the kind of legislation Chairman INHOFE is working on in the EPW Committee. We all need to get together and get away from purely voluntary standards and into something that is actually more important for all of us to do in order to make sure all facilities are addressed. That is why. 3 years ago. .[ first introduced the Chemical Security Act. My bill would have required chemical facilities to assess their vulnerabilities. establish priorities in the Nation. develop plans to improve security. and use inherently safer technologies. We have had to move away from that to get something done. But I think we still need those plans and we need accountability to make sure the plans are in place. I would like to see us work with safer technologies that are available. I think we can help some of the companies transition financially if that were necessary. But I do think we need to move forward. So far. we have not been able to get legislation passed and the exposure continues at least with some subset of the facilities around. I think it is time for us to move. I thought my approach was common sense. fairly simple. and it actually gave a lot of flexibility. It has been frustrating not to see this legislation dealt with. When it was first introduced. it got a 220 supporting vote in the EPW Committee. until the process of lobbying and other considerations came into play and a lot of folks backed away from it. I am hopeful people will wake up to the reality that there is real exposure in our communities. It is time to act. Hot air and lots of words by people doing television shows. ""60 Minutes."" and writing newspaper articles is not enough. We need to have accountability and real standards to protect the American people. I know I feel that way about our folks in New Jersey. and I am going to feel as if I have not done my job if one of our plants is attacked and people lose lives because we have not done what we need to do to make sure they are safe. This is a place that recognizes the problemby the way. every time we send out a Code Orange. we cite plant facilities as one of the areas that needs to be attended to by State and local law enforcement. That is where my amendment comes in today. I am not actually talking about this particular bill at this point in time. It actually hasnt come through another process. In this particular amendment. the appropriations bill. I think there is the opportunity to make a modest first step by appropriating money to support State and local efforts to enhance chemical plant security. As I said. when we raise the code levels. we are asking State and local folks to go out and provide extra security around these plants. By the way. you may wonder why the public is doing the work in providing the security. but since it is happening. I think we ought to provide resources to make that happen. The amendment I am introducing would provide $100 million for that purpose. Funds could be used. for example. to strengthen law enforcements presence around chemical plants. prepare officials for responding to a terrorist attack in a chemical facilitya complicated issue. not exactly like fighting fire. it is somewhat different. It will provide assistance to plant managers and other steps State and local officials might take to protect their communities. This is a straightforward amendment. We need to put money and resources into this potentially deadly concern in our homeland security. Not unlike port and rail security. I think this is an area where there is general recognition that there is exposure and we need to move forward. As I have said. there are literally millions of people who have exposure. We have a legacy of these chemical plants being located in densely populated areas. not everywhere. We should prioritize. We ought to have a different standard for ammonia plants in South Dakota than when you are in Carney. NJ. in the midst of 12 million people in the metropolitan area of New Jersey and New York. There is a difference. But we need to make sure we have security plans that people are held accountable to. both industry and the local communities. So I am hopeful we will be able to positively consider this $100 million first stepa small stepand I will ask for a positive conclusion. Assuming that a point of order is raised against this amendmentI dont see anybody on the floor. but maybe the Chair will do it. It may not happen. I will leave that for another time. I hope we can have a positive consideration of this amendment to protect chemical plants. Madam President. I see the Senator from Massachusetts rising. I certainly dont want to stand in the way of his accessing the floor. I was going to speak as in morning business on the economy. I intended it to be for 10 to 15 minutes.",2855,2855_chemical_facilities_plants_chemicals,"['chemical', 'facilities', 'plants', 'chemicals', 'cfats', '4007', 'vulnerability', 'dhs', 'plant', 'vulnerabilities']",chemical - facilities - plants - chemicals - cfats - 4007 - vulnerability - dhs - plant - vulnerabilities,0.519860896,TRUE,1080178604

287119,Mr. Speaker. I rise In strong support of H.R. 2264. the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act. and I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of it. I want to thank Secretary of State Colin Powell. Congressman CLAY SHAW and all cosponsoring membersof Congress for making the preservation of the Congo River Basin a priority. While it is unfortunate that the other body cut the authorization of funds for fiscal year 2005 for this initiative. the $18.6 million for 2004 will send a strong signal for the need for U.S. investment to preserve the Congo River Basin. The Congo River and its tributaries make up the most extensive network of navigable waterways in Africa and carry a volume of water second only to the Amazon River. Some of us think first of the Congo River Basin as one of the largest and more important ecological regions of the world. which it is. But. what is more important. it is the home to some of the worlds poorest people who have suffered some of Africas bloodiest conflicts. More than two and a half million people have perished in Eastern Congo as a result of the most recent Congo civil war. with millions left displaced and in unimaginable destitution. Throughout the central African region. poverty rates are among the lowest in the world. Life expectancy ranges from 42 years in the Central Africa Republic to 52 in the Congo Republic. The overall forest area of the Congo River Basin is declining rapidly as a result of the unchecked growth of timber exports. destructive agricultural expansion. and fuel wood demand for a growing population. These practices are unsustainable .if the assets of the Congo River Basin are to be used to improve and sustain the lives of the people who live there. Mr. Speaker. this legislation represents a unique opportunity to help the people of Central Africa turn their biggest assetthe natural resources of the Congo River Basin4nto a viable economic base. The Congo River Basin. Partnership is an economic development and conservation program for the six countries of Central Africa. The partnership will combine the preservation of some of the worlds richest and most pristine ecosystems with economic development in order to alleviate poverty throughout the region. Conservation programs will help develop a network of national parks and protected areas. and help local communities better manage the forest and wildlife. People of Central Africa. some of whom live on less than 25cents per day. will be able to develop sustainable means of livelihood through conservation agriculture and integrated ecotourism programs. Mr. Speaker. with substantial international efforts. the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo that engulfed the region has come to an end. The Congolese and other nations in the region are disarming and demobilizing armed groups. planning for national elections. and embracing the rule of law. This is the beginning of a new beginning for postcolonial Central Africa. The politics of the Cold War failed the region. the postCold War neglect turned Central Africa into a human disaster. We dont know how long it will take to establish a stable region in the heart of Africa. but we do know we must start. Mr. Chairman. the Congo River Basin Initiative has created a window of opportunity to help the people of Central Africa rebuild their communities. establish local economies. and bring health care and other resources to their countries. This initiative will help demonstrate that the stewardship of the Congo River Basin is the joint responsibility of Central African countries and the international community. It is important to note that the first international meeting of the Congo Basin Forest Partnership met in Paris in January of this year to launch a strong effort for international cooperation to preserve the Congo River Basin. Together. we must end the deforestation and wildlife depletion and support the appropriate use of forest resources. I support this bill and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage.,6532,6532_congo_basin_2264_gabon,"['congo', 'basin', '2264', 'gabon', 'icca', 'partnership', 'conservation', 'africa', 'pack', 'forest']",congo - basin - 2264 - gabon - icca - partnership - conservation - africa - pack - forest,1,TRUE,1080116823

310625,"I thank the Chair. Mr. President. I have come to the floor to briefly discuss this amendment that has been offered by the Senator from New Hampshire and others and tell the Senate this is opening the door to a whole series of agreements that were made in previous Congresses and approved by the President. and it is a subject I intend to debate at length. I will tell the Senate a little bit of history tonight and take an opportunity to more subsequently discuss this issue-. This amendment that has been offered will prevent the use of Federal funds to plan. design. study. or construct new forest development roads in the Tongass. The Tongass National Forest is our largest national forest. It has a southern division and a northern division. When I came to the Senate. the harvest level was about 1.5 billion board feet a year from the total Tongass. In subsequent years it has been under attack severely. until today I think it is less than 17 percent of the Tongass is available for harvesting timber. This amendment discriminates against Alaska. There are national forests in many States and the Forest Service spends a lot of money on forest roads. but this would say that only in Alaska can the Forest Service be prohibited from spending money for forest roads. Let me go back a little bit in the history. I am gathering the information we need to address the matter in depth tomorrow and subsequently. This area is not unique in the sense of timber harvest. The Forest Service follows about the same regulations in Alaska they would in any other national forest. The difference is that we had. in 1980. the Alaskan National Interests Conservation Land Act which withdrew a great portion of this forest from any future harvesting of timber. then after that we had the Tongass Timber Reform Act which further limited the amount that could be harvested from the Tongass. and then we had the enormous dispute over roads in the Tongass. This is another way to limit the development of Alaskas timber because of the policies of our national Government with regard to harvesting the national forests. The debate over forest roads also has included the question of the provisions in the 1980 act which prohibited any further withdrawal of Alaskas lands without prior approval of the Congress. This is an amendment that looks as if there is an economic concept involved. but really it is one of the goals of those who want to limit further use of the Tongass to produce timber. Regarding the.roadless concept. they tried to apply it to our national forests. the Tongass National Forest. Because of the provisions in the 1980 act which prohibit further withdrawals of Alaskas land without prior approval of the Congress. that concept did 4ot get applied to the Tongass. The last President did issue an Executive order which purported to change that. but that has been rescinded as that was an error on the part of the last administration. We are operating under the basis that there could be roads built in the portions of the Tongass that have not been withdrawn. The problem is this: The cost of developing roads in Alaska are different from other States. In most States. there is a road infrastructure in the area that surrounds the national forest. As a matter of fact. most national forests have a Federal highway going right through them. Southeast Alaska has no roads. It is an island community. There is no connection between those islands. There is no attempt to build a highway system in southeast Alaska. As amatter of fact. our capital city has no roads that can be used to enter Juneau from another area. I think it is the only capital you can reach only by boat or air. There is no way to drive to our capital because it is on one of the islands I am talking about. When we look at the situation of southeast Alaska. we have to realize one of the costs of developing a timber industry in southeast Alaska is building roads on islands on which there are no roads. They are temporary roads built under specification of the Forest Service and designed to become wilderness. in effect. once the regrowth is commenced. What I am saying is. once the timber is harvested. the natural product of what we call the ""slash"" that comes from developing and cutting the timber is laid across the ground. and within a very few years that area will be totally grown over again. In most instances. we will not find the roads because they have been eliminated by regrowth. I invite everyone to take a look at Admiralty Island. across from Juneau. That at one time -was cut for timber and now is regrown to such an extent that it has been named a wilderness area. It is the only area in the country that is a wilderness area despite .the. fact that its timber was once cut. As we get the information I am seeking from the Forest Service and from other agencies. I want to demonstrate to the Senate that the only way to be able to harvest the timber we are entitled to harvest. is to follow the process the Forest Service itself has selected: that is. that it build the forest -roads. As it selects an area for timber harvest. it will build the roads. and the purchaser of the timber will agree to pay the cost of those roads as part of the cost of the contract to harvest the timber. As time has passed and many of our areas have been selected for harvest in the area set aside for timber production nowI remind the Senate that well over threefourths of the Tongass has been set aside as national parks. wild and scenic rivers. forest wilderness. and is not available for any kind of timber harvest. In the areas where it was agreed timber harvests would be permitted. the Forest Service builds these roads and uses the funds we appropriate for that purpose. and those funds are repaid by the person! who harvests the timber. As time has passed. the challenges from the environmental organizations of the country. the environmental costs. the environmental impact statements. and "" oftenrepeated environmental impact statements. have added up to the fact that some assert that this is not a profitable endeavor. for the Federal Government to allow timber to be harvested in the Tongass. But they forgetand that is why I am herethey forget there was an understanding and a commitment that a portion of this area would be available for timber harvest. That is one of the local products that is a renewable resource. The cutting cycle in our timber area is over 100 years. It means an area harvested this year will not be put up for sale for 100 years. Under the circumstances. to have a provision that * says the roads that are to be built would be built by an individual in advance of getting a contract for timber harvesting means that great speculation would enter into this industry. It would also mean that the decision would be made by nonresidents of the area. speculators. Currently our log: ging industry is a local industry. They are small logging companies. They log small areas on the islands at a competitive bid to obtain the right to harvest that timber. This is nota case of wasting Federal money. Those who are approaching it from the point of view. saying the Federal Government should not spend this money. do not realize the best way to develop this timber industry was to have roads built by a Federal agency. designed by a Federal agency. and constructed for the safety not only of the people who are going to be working in the area but also for the protection of other resources such as the fish and wildlife resources of the area. The problem for a person who wants to harvest this area is overwhelming if they have to make the decision of where the road should go because there is so much interFederalagency consultation going into the harvests. these roads for timber harvest. that it would be almost impossible for a private sector person to be able to get to the point where there would be approval for the location of the road. The design is determined by the Federal Government. the location is determined by the Federal Government. the safety features are determined by the Federal Government. and the purchaser of the timber has agreed to pay the costs. The way it is done right now is in the best way. in the interests of the environment. and the interest of the people of the area. Once the roads are built. it is possible for the local people to be able to bid to harvest the timber and to make it available to the international community. By Federal law. we do not export this timber. It must be sold in the United States. This is from Federal land. and therefore is subject to the Federal law that prohibits the export of this timber. It is a forest product that would be worth a great deal more if it could be exported. But it is not. Some of the Nativeowned timber is. exported. but the timber from the Federal lands is not exported. The main reason I am here ig to ask the Senate to think about this. This is a provision that applies only in the Tongass National Forest of Alaska. Why not the rest of the country? Why not the forests in New Hampshire? There is a forest in New Hampshire. What about the forests of other areas of the country? I am considering offering a seconddegree amendmentI understand seconddegree amendments will be in order and are in orderto apply it to the whole country. Ab6ve all. what about the commitment made to Alaska when so much of Alaska was withdrawn? In 1980. the law that was passed we called the Alaska National Interests Land Conservation Act which withdrew over 100 million acres. That was a hardfought battle that lasted .7 years in this Senate. We finally reached a conclusion that many of my constituents disagreed with. that in order to go forward with our economy and in order to go forward with our relationship with the Federal Government. we agreed to that act. It became -law despite the fact that so many people disagreed with it because it did have some commitments to Alaska. This is one of the commitments. that the areas that were not set aside would be subject to harvest by the timber industry under the concepts that existed at the time. Now if we come along and change those concepts and say you cannot use Federal funds -in the beginning. it means we will have to go back and fashion a basic Federal law that deals with the investment of private funds in thos6 roads before the decision has been madeit is almost impossible for anyone to conceive building roads in an area before the final decision has been made that the timber can be harvested. The decision used to be made just by the Forest Service. but it is made by the courts now. Every single sale has gone to court repeatedly. Two years ago. I had an amendment to limit the amount of time that could b e taken in those appeals. That is an issue that needs to be examined. But very clearly. the concept of using this approach that none of the funds available in this act may be used for the development of the these roads is another way to make the area wilderness. This is a wilderness bill. This is not an economic amendment. This is an amendment to assure that the commitment was made to us that a portion of the timber in the Tongass could be harvested. This will be reneging on that commitment. There is no way now for us to proceed with this type of road construction until we identify the purchaser of the timber. and. there is no way really to get to the point of purchasing the timber until the roads are created. There are no roads available in the area except the ones to be constructed by the logging company that will cut the timber. I am sure the sponsors of this amendment do not realize what they are setting in motion. They are setting in motion a total block to development of the Tongass and a total reneging on the commitment that was made to our State that timber in this area would be subject to harvest. I hope to have an amendment that will make this apply to the whole country. I also have an amendment that I would want the Senate to consider. and that is that there should be a study made of the developing of these roads in the f<orest system. and that there be a report on a new process to develop roads in the units of the National Forest System if we are not to use Federal funds to build the roads. Again I say. from the point of view of safety. from the point of view of consistency as far as environmental protection. having the Forest Service build the roads in the areas that they agree to be available for timber harvesting is the best way we have devised so far. This concept. if it is to be studied. it ought to be studied throughout the whole National Forest Service System. not just my State. not just our State. I do think there is a great deal more to this debate that needs to be brought up to the Senate. But above all. people have asked: Why dont we just have a vote? The main reason is I think there are Senators- here who really do not know the history of the development of this relationship between Alaska and the Federal Government with regard to the resources of our State. If you look at the 1980 act that withdrew over 100 million acres. you will find that because of those withdrawals you cannot build a northsouth road in Alaska. You cannot build an eastwest road in Alaska. There is no way to get through the various passes and across the rivers where you should be able to do it because withdrawals were made for national parks. wild and scenic rivers. There are a whole category of withdrawals to prevent that kind of development. There actually was a Senator on the floor of the Senate at one time who said our whole State should be made a national park and we should not be allowed to develop any portion of it. Our State is onefifth the size of the United States. It is as big as at least 20 of the 48 States of what we call the South 48. We are entitled to a lifestyle. We are entitled to be treated as a State. We fought long and hard to become .a State. What we are seeing here is this inching away from being treated as a State. This amendment only applies to Alaska. Of all the units of the forest system in the United States. it would only apply to Alaska. I think that type of discrimination should be reason enough for any Senator to vote against this amendment. But above all. I do hope the Senate will take time with us. My colleague. Senator MURKOWSKI. will be with me tomorrow. and we will discuss this amendment at length. Right now. I just have to express my deep disappointment in an amendment of this type. I cannot conceive of offering an amendment to discriminate against another State. We sought to become a member of this Union because we thought we would be equal to other States. We have witnessed. time and time again. this attitude of people from other parts of the country that we are not entitled to the same rights as other Americans in terms of our relationship to the Federal Govarnment. I think this is an area that needs examination. And it needs understanding. I cannot recall since I have been here holding up an appropriations bill. This one I do think is going to be held up. I want the Senate to know that I have a whole series of amendments that will be offered to this amendment. I do not take lightly the attack on our State. a discriminatory attack on Alaska. There are few Senators who have been privileged to be part of a battle for statehood for their State who end up on the floor of the Senate. I think one of my d)uties as a Senator for Alaska is to see to it that we are not discriminated against. And this is a discriminatory amendment. one that really disturbs me. as I have indicated. greatly. I do hope those who come from States that have national forests will examine the practices in their States. One of the strange things about this is we have inquired from the Forest Service about the money they are spending for roads in each of the forests. The way they handle the money. it is not too easy to find out how much money is being spent in each of the forests. But clearly we know there are forest roads being built in the national forests in other States. I believe the Senate should understand the gravity of this kind of discrimination against my State. I am not offering these amendments yet because*I want to confer with my colleague who went home this past weekend since there are no votes today. I will be here tomorrow to try to explain further our amendments. But I do want to explain to my friends who are the managers of this bill. I hope they will not become overly disturbed with us. But we want to find some way to convince the Senate not to discriminate against our State. If there is some change that should be made to forest roads. it should apply to all forests. And if there is some concept of making a decision with regard .to the economics of this aspect of this. lets decide what to do with the Forest Service altogether. not just the Forest Service that applies to Alaska. I close with what I started. Last year. I think we harvested less than 200 million board feet of timber. less than oneseventh of what was harvested the year I came to the Senate. Successive Congresses have found ways to whittle away. whittle away. whittle away at our ability to use the resources of our State. I think this is a time to ask the Senate to pause and consider that.

330544,"Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleague. Senator COLLINS. in introducing the ""Chemical Facility AntiTerrorism Act of 2005. I am also delighted that Senators COLEMAN. LEVIN. and CARPER will be joining us on this bill. This bill is the product of extensive work in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to explore the risks of a possible terrorist attack on our chemical facilities. as well as the best means to guard against those risks. Since 911 opened our eyes to the threats we face on U.S. soil from Islamist terrorist groups. we have moved to improve security for many of the critical elements of our society and economy. But somehow 4e have not yet protected one of our greatest vulnerabilities the chemical sector. Chemicals are vital to many of the processes that feed us. heal us. and power our economy: Yet the very pervasiveness of the chemical sector makes it vulnerable to terrorism. Thousands of facilities throughout the country use or store lethal materials. often near large population centers. We know that terrorists are interested in targeting these facilities. The Congressional Research Service reports that during the 1990s. both international and domestic terrorists attempted to use explosives to release chemicals from manufacturing and storage facilities close to population centers. The Justice Department in 2002 described the threat posed by terrorists to chemical facilities as ""both real and credible."" for the foreseeable future. Former White House Homeland Security Advisor Richard Falkenrath this spring told the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that although chemical facilities are a most serious homeland security vulnerability. the Federal Government has done almost nothing to secure them. Homeland Security expert Steve Flynn likened the Nations 15.000 chemical facilities to ""15.000 weapons of mass destruction littered around the United States."" Fortunately. the responsible players in the chemical industry have not waited for Federal legislation. and some of the leading trade groups have begun their own security programs or participated in some voluntary efforts led by DHS. Some chemical facilities are also subject to security regulation under the Maritime Transportation Security Act or the Bioterrorism Act of 2002. Yetthese programs do not reach the full range of security matters addressed at the committees hearings and in this legislation. More significant. far too many facilities that use extremely hazardous chemicals remain entirely outside the patchwork of laws. regulations. and selfprotection now in place. For several years. legislation to require security enhancements at these chemical sites has foundered in Congress. bereft of true administration support or Congressional consensus. But I am hopeful that today marks a turning point that will culminate in successful passage of a robust chemical security bill. First. the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has worked on a bipartisan basis to build a foundation for this effort: through four hearings that explored the issues and possible solutions regarding chemical site security and through collaboration on this legislatidn that has already won strong bipartisan support on our Committee. Second. DHS has now clearly statedin testimony to our committeethat -the current voluntary efforts are not sufficient and that the Department needs new legislative authority to regulate chemical site security. Third. responsible segments of the chemical industrysuch as the American Chemistry Councilhave recognized the need for a comprehensive national program to ensure adequate security across the entire chemical sector and called for Federal legislation. I welcome this engagement by industry and believe we can work together with them. as well as the administration. and all who are concerned about security. to forge an effective national program. This legislation is a forceful but pragmatic response to the challenge of chemical site security. It directs its greatest force and focus to those facilities that pose the highest risk in terms of potential loss of human life or other catastrophic results. It authorizes the Department. of Homeland Security to initiate a thoroughgoing security program for thousands of critical chemical sites around the country. The Secretary. would identify which facilities pose a meaningful risk due to terrorism concerns.- and then require these facilities to conduct a vulnerability assessment and prepare a security plan and emergency response plan to address the results of this vulnerability analysis. Facilities within the program would submit these assessments and plans to DHS for review and approval. DHS would then work with the facilities to ensure the plans. and implementation. are adequate. Under a tiered system of requirements. those facilities that pose the greatest risk would face the most stringent security requirements as well as a speedier and more rigorous DHS review. The bill includes civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance and. ultimately. facilities may be ordered to shut down if they do not comply with DHS orders. This legislation recognizes that facilities will need flexibility to achieve security in the most efficient and effective manner. The bill also recognizes the work of the responsible chemical companies within the chemical sector and does not force those facilities to reinvent the wheel. Instead. the bill ensures that so long as an alternative security programs assessments and plans meet the bills core requirements for vulnerability assessments and site security plans. facilities operating under those alternative security programs can submit these assessments and plans under the DHS program. However. where the assessments and plans do not meet the bills core requirements. the Secretary will require appropriate modifications. Finally. the Secretary will judge all assessments and plans against the regulations promulgated under this bill. ?This legislation also recognizes that sometimes the best security will come not from adding guards and gates but from reexamining the way chemical operations are carried out in order to reduce the amount of hazardous substances on site. improve the way they are stored or processed or find safer substitutes for the chemicals. themselves. These changes serve to make a facility less inviting as a target for terrorists. as well as limiting the loss of life or other damage if an attack does take place. They also have the added benefit of limiting the harm from an accidental release. This bill clearly requires facilities to look at the risks and consequences related to the dangerous chemicals on site and address those specific vulnerabilities in their security plan. And it -includes these .process changes among the menu of security measures that chemical facilities should examine when designing their security plans. We know that many facilities.-and many security experts. already look to these less dangerous technologies as a potent and costeffective way to improve security against a possible terror attack. But we also know that. for some facilities. there can be reluctance or structural impediments to looking at these technological solutions. That is why I feel. this bill should go further and include more explicit requirements for chemical facilities to consider less dangerous technologies when they make the security enhancements required under this bill. In particular. the riskier facilitiessome of which could .endanger tens or hundreds of thousands of lives if attackedshould have to demonstrate that they have looked closely at options that would reduce the catastrophic consequences of a possible terrorist attack. We had a powerful example of such an adjustment close by: after 911 focused our attention on potential targets in our midst. Washington DCs water treatment facility ended the use of its potentially deadly liquid chlorine. This is not a question of forcing industry to conduct its operations off a Governmentissued playbook. Companies would analyze for themselves whether there are less dangerous ways to conduct their business and would not be forced to implement any changes that were not feasible. But given the extraordinary risks involved. it makes little sense not to require companies to at least take a long hard look at some of the commonsense solutions that have been advocated or already adopted by others within the industry. Therefore. as this bill advances. I will seek to. strengthen the requirements for facilities to carefully consider these safer technologies as a means to greater security. The bill creates structure within DHS to oversee this regulatory pro.gram and a regional network to help implement its provisions. particularly to help ensure adequate emergency response capabilities in the event of an attack on a chemical facility. There are also provisions to safeguard sensitive information that DHS receives from the chemical facilities. while at the same time requiring DHS to share and disclose information necessary for public safety and public accountability. Thebill does not affect chemical facilities obligations to make information available to the public under righttoknow laws or other regulatory programs. and it establishes a secure channel by which members of the public can submit information about potential problems regarding the security of chemical facilities. This bill also recognizes that Congress is not the only body that can and should help ensure the safety and sectirity of the Nations chemical facilities. States and localities have long regulated such facilities for various safety and environmental concerns. Since 911. some States have also moved to require security improvements at these facilities. These State and local protections are critical adjuncts to our effort at the Federal level. and I am pleased that this bill states clearly that it does not preempt State and local laws or regulations regarding the safety and security of chemical facilities. States and localities are free to enact more stringent chemical security legislation. Only if there is an absolute conflict. such that it is impossible for a facility to comply with both the Federal law and a State or local law or regulation on chemical security. would the Federal provision take precedence. The bill would not disrupt State and local safety and environmental law regarding chemical facilities. nor does it dislodge or alter the operation of State common law with respect to such facilities.",2855,2855_chemical_facilities_plants_chemicals,"['chemical', 'facilities', 'plants', 'chemicals', 'cfats', '4007', 'vulnerability', 'dhs', 'plant', 'vulnerabilities']",chemical - facilities - plants - chemicals - cfats - 4007 - vulnerability - dhs - plant - vulnerabilities,0.454387222,TRUE,1090102336

338582,"Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing the ""Higher Education Sustainability Act of 2005."" which would authorize $50 million for 25 Sustainability Education Programs across the country to develop and implement integrated environmental. economic. and social sustainability programs. Each Sustainability Program will focus on multidisciplinary research. education. and outreach at institutions of higher education. Sustainable development practices are being advanced b. hundreds of U.S. cities and companies and through a variety of international agencies including the United Nations and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. As population growth. urban development and extreme weather incidents place great stress on ecosystems around the globe. the need for developing innovative and successful sustainable development practices becomes critical to sustaining our economic competitiveness. improving our environmental health and creating more livable communities. In my home State of Oregon. we have many great examples of sustainable development and livable communities. Portland State University. located in my hometown. provides an excellent example of how to incorporate sustainability throughout the curriculum. Faculty from the departments of social sciences. life sciences. physical sciences. humanities. as well as the professional schools have been working to incorporate sustainability principles in their coursework and research. Portland State Universitys Sustainability Initiative has placed a high priority on Green Buildings on campus that use smart technology to improve operational performance and produce significant savings. The City of Portland awarded PSUs. Stephen Epler Residence Hall and Broadway Housing with the Businesses for an Environmentally Sustainable Tomorrow award for sustainable stormwater management. The Epler buildings harvests rainwater from the roof for use in restrooms and features lowflow water fixtures for showers and toilets resulting in cost savings of $5.000 each year. The Broadway Housing features 20.000 square feet of an ""ecoroof."" one of the largest in a dense urban environment. Faculty and students designed a monitoring program to measure impacts of the ecoroof and preliminary studies show a 21 percent reduction in runoff. This is an exemplary example of how faculty uses the buildings as real laboratories. These innovations are just a few among many that are already underway in colleges and universities across the nation. This legislation will ensure that we can extend these innovations to institutions of higher learning across the country. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and make a commitment to making our educational communities more sustainable and livable.",2761,2761_environmental_sustainability_steinbrenner_farmingdale,"['environmental', 'sustainability', 'steinbrenner', 'farmingdale', 'green', 'ecklund', 'apecs', '3036', 'ohlone', 'sustainable']",environmental - sustainability - steinbrenner - farmingdale - green - ecklund - apecs - 3036 - ohlone - sustainable,0.91470502,TRUE,1090056124
340893,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman. as well. for joining us here this afternoon and also for the work that he has already done on the committee. I commend him for that. I know the gentleman is -well respected by all of our colleagues for his insightfulness and levelheadedness as far as addressing this issue because. as he pointed out. we could be going in either extreme on this issue. .Probably. when we get into the debate on this legislation next week. whether it becomes partisan or not. I can imagine that there will be extremes from both sides. so I appreciate the gentlemans moderation on this and his hard work on this. I am sure the gentleman joins with me in supporting the gentleman from Illinois (Chairman HYDE). In essence. what the committee is doing is they are looking for in the Re-"" form Act of 2005. these are my words. not the committees words. but they are looking for oversight. accountability. and cutting bureaucracy. I guess the same thing that they were always looking for in any form of entity. government or otherwise. that plays an important role in our lives. We do not want a huge bureaucracy. we do want a level of accountability so we know who is responsible and we can hold them accountable for what they have done. and we want oversight. We want somebody. as the gentleman from Indiana alluded to. somebody. some apparatus who would be in a position to be able to step back for a moment and take a look at the situation as a whole and see whether they are complying with their overall charter and complying with their overall mission. E 1511 As we have alluded to already this evening. we already know throughout history they have not been doing so. so now we have to decide what to do with it. I referenced before the problems. the ongoing investigation with the U.N. and what they have found so far. The behavior of the U.N. up to date. in my opinion. is *just totally indefensible with regard to their investigations and the investigations that they are taking. blocking for Congress to take. I. for one. take the position. and have signed on to legislation that we had last year when these issues first came up. to say that we should be suspending all. we should be suspending all funding to the U.N. until they agree to fully cooperat6 and provide us with that level of accountability. The gentleman from Arizona has legislation that addresses the issue and says that we should be withholding some level of funding to the U.N. until there is a true accounting. until we can certify that we actually know- where all of that money went to. Remember how much we were talking about here? $21 billion hasbeen effectively stol en. stolen from the people of Iraq. the poor. destitute people of Iraq. during the entire scandal by Saddam Hussein and other people around the world and his regime. the largest theft. I guess. in world history. And we are just looking for an accountability for that. It is really an outrage when you think about it. The American public should be outraged about what has occurred at the U.N. The world community should be outraged about what occurred at the U.N.. and right over in Iraq in the work of Saddam Hussein and right under the noses of the administrators at the U.N.? A $21 billion scandal. and it is only now beginning to have the facts come out. We have a responsibility as Members of the Congress to continue with this investigation. We have a responsibility. as alluded to before by the gentleman from Indiana . to make sure that if we are going to be providing them any of your hardearned tax dollars that we will get to the bottom of it. hold those people responsible for what their actions were. for participating in or profiting from this outrage. They need to lose their jobs or go to jail or both. So that is just one tip of the iceberg problem with the U.N. And I can allude just to a point how this impacts upon the world issue. world community as far as security and terrorism is concerned. I think I have the chart here. I referenced before what Saddam Hussein was able to do with the money. buy houses and palaces and military. But part of it. also. in not too complex an arrangement here. part of it also helped to facilitate suicide bombers which we see on TV more frequently than any of us want. But suicide bombers in other parts of the world as well? I mentioned before thatthere was a situation where he was getting kickbacks from payments from companies in the OilforFood program. Some of that money then went to a bank account in Jordan. There was also rev-. enue coming into the regime. a $3 a barrel fee for oil. That was paid by the Jordanian Government.as part of their agreement over with Iraq to get some of money out. Again. that money ended up in a Jordanian bank account there. There is a bank. Rafidian Bank in Iraq. That money was there. and other sources as well. I should say. The top line here shows sources of money: kickbacks. fee per barrel and other sources of funds as well. All of that money coming into the regime. and where did it go? Into the various bank accounts that regime controlled. And eventually out of that bank account and to the families of suicide bombers. $15. $20. $25. upwards of $35.000 each was going to the families of. suicide bombers to help them out and to encourage that heinous type of action that we see as life is being taken from other families and individuals. The regime was supporting it. The U.N. was basically facilitating it by allowing it to occur under their noses.

365830,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to honor Dale Antonich. who is retiring after 33 of Rem qrks E1543 years of service with the National Park Service. Dale began his career with the National Park Service as a seasonal park ranger at the Grand Canyon in 1972. For the next four years. Dale held a variety of seasonal laoorer. park technician and ranger jobs. His seasonal employment included assignments in the Grand Canyon. Lake Mead National Recreation Area (NRA) and Death Valley National Park. In 1977. he accepted a fulltime career position as a park technician at Golden Gate National Park. Dale accepted a promotion in 1981 as a park ranger in the Santa Monica Mountains NRA. In 1984. Dale moved from the Santa Monica Mountains NRA to the Grand Teton National Park. accepting a promotion to law enforcement specialist park ranger. In 1986. Dale was selected for the Chief Ranger position at Death Valley National Park. He became the Chief Ranger at Lake Mead NRA in 1991. a position he held for the remainder of his career. Over the course of his 33 year career. Dale has received a number of awards: the Commendation for a Rescue at Grand Canyon. and the Member of Unit Citation for Rescue at Lake Mead in 1974. he received the Commendation for Rescue performed at Golden Gate National Park in 1978. the Sustained Superior Performance Award in 1984. and the U.S. Department of the Interior Award for Rescue in 1991. Dale also received the highest award that can be bestowed upon a ranger by his peers. the Henry Yount Award. He received this award in 1999 from thenVice President Al Gore. Dale has dedicated his professional career to the mission of the National Parks Service. He has committed his life to the resources. park visitors. park staff and our partners. He has provided leadership in the development and management of emerging operations. and the professionalization of ranger positions within the National Park System. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to honor Dale Antonich for his years spent the National Park Service. Dales experience. commitment. contributions and dedication to his job will be -surely missed.

379129,"I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. since 1982 the Forest Service has lost $850 million sub-. sidizing private timber in the Tongass National Forest. That is a $40 million annual loss. If anyone wonders why our national debt is as large as it is. and it is currently $8.3 trillion. by the way. one needs to look no farther than taxpayer boondoggles like this one. They really add up. The Tongass National Forest was established in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt. It is Americas largest forest. about the size of West Virginia. Located along Alaskas southeastern coast. it is often referred to as ""Americas Rainforest"" and is home to abundant wildlife: bald eagles. grizzly bears. wolves. and salmon. as well as old growth trees such as the giant Sitka spruce. western hemlock. and yellow -cedar. There are thousands of miles of roads in the Tongass right now. The Forest Service acknowledges that existing roads are ""sufficient to satisfy local demand for roaded recreation. subsistence. community connectivity needs and demands in most districts."" Yet year after year the Forest Service spends millions of tax dollars building roads for private timber companies that by the agencys own admission are not really necessary. To make matters worse. the Forest Service has a nationwide road maintenance backlog of about $10 billion. tens of millions of which are in the Tongass. Incredibly. the Forest Service is not maintaining existing roads. yet they want to build more. even though they admit there are enough already. The timber program is not a profitftble business in the Tongass the way the Forest Service is currently running it. Nobody argues this. The Forest Service concedes that 90 to 95 percent of all existing timber sale contracts in the Tongass are unprofitable. Nearly half of Tongass timber contracts go unsold. Of those that are sold. the majority have only a single bidder. resulting in a bargain basement. discounted sale. Mr. Chairman. this is a simple. straightforward amendment. It would simply prohibit the Forest Service from building logging roads for timber companies subsidized by the American taxpayer in the Tongass. It does not prevent the Forest Service from building roads to connect communities. to provide recreation. or to otherwise manage the forest. It does not stop timber companies from building their own roads. I know that there are some who want you to believe differently. but this amendment has nothing to do with the roadless rule. It has everything to do with good government. Opponents of this amendment will argue that the massive losses in the Tongass are due to litigation. that taxpayer dollars are ending up in the"" pockets of trial lawyers. Mr. Chairman. I am not often accused of being a darling of the trial lawyers. As some may know. the Freedom of Information Act request was filed with the Forest Service in 2002. Although the request was to be for the years ranging from 1991 to 2001. the Forest Service could only provide numbers from 1998 to 2001. During that time the Forest Service spent $121 million on its timber program. Litigation costs amounted to $1.6 million. That means only 2 percent of the total cost were spent on appeals and litigation. Just 2 percent. Opponents of this amendment will say that the National Environmental Policy Act requirements also increase costs. and they are right. The NEPA process needs reform. and I supported legislation to do this. as many of us have. But whether we like it or not. NEPA is on the books. To gouge taxpayers year after year and justify it by pointing to burdensome environmental requirements is just wrong. Some say this amendment is an attempt to take away jobs in Alaska. It is not. In fact. as timber subsidies have increased. timberrelated jobs have decreased. Taxpayer subsidies per Tongass timber job have risen from $12.000 in 1996 to over $150.000 per job now. Think of that. Every job. $150.000 in taxpayer subsidy for that one job. Finally. according to a 2003 National Forest Service publication. there is enough timber available off the current road system of the Tongass to meet demand for several years. Mr. Chairman. let us restore some fiscal sanity to the Tongass timber program. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the American taxpayers and support this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.",2643,2643_tongass_roadless_timber_forest,"['tongass', 'roadless', 'timber', 'forest', 'roads', 'logging', 'forests', 'inventoried', 'harvest', 'harvesting']",tongass - roadless - timber - forest - roads - logging - forests - inventoried - harvest - harvesting,0.572028027,TRUE,1090134815

390881,"Mr. President. I have come to the floor to speak about something that is going on in the West as we speak. that is a tragedy in reality and something that certainly we all ought to be aware of. As I got on the plane Friday morning in Minneapolis in my commute to Idaho. a group of young men and women got on my plane: firefighters of the State of Missouri. They were flying to Idaho to help Idahoans extinguish the wildfires burning there. I thank them and all of the brave firefighters who have been battling these immense wildfires in a season that is dramatic as we speak. I got on the plane yesterday morning in Boise to return to Washington. Another group of young men and women. bedraggled. tired. and smelling of smoke. got on the plane to fly back to Minneapolis. That was another group of firefighters who were flown in from the Eastern United States to help out in Idaho and the Great Basin West. They were simply tired and returning home. We are. in Idaho and in the West. at this moment experiencing one of the most dramatic wildfire seasons in our history. I say that because the season in reality has just started. From a historic perspective. it is late July. August. and September that the fire season we think of on our public lands. both forested and grasslands. usually begins. Last year. we went through the worst fire season in history based on total acreage burned.. As I speak. we are now ahead of last year and burning even greater. Headlines in the local largest daily in Idaho yesterday said: more fires burning in Idaho than any other State in the Nation. well over 600.000 acres burned and many burning. Yesterday morning. five counties in the State of Idaho were declared a state of emergency due to those wildfires burning. Currently. the largest fire burning in the United States is the Murphy complex. estimated to be 570.000 acres. 7.500 people were evacuated from the area. Evacuations were being ordered across the State dueto the number of fires and the extreme of the fire behavior: 100degree temperatures in an area where that extraordinary heat has reduced the dew point to such a situation that anything that grows becomes kindling for a wildfire. Of the 72 large fires in the United States. half of those burning today are"" in the State of Nevada and in my State of Idaho. The weather outlook has gone from bad to horrible. as these temperatures continue and as the Great Basin of the United States progressively dries out. More hot and dry weather is expected along with dry lightning. fires. and wind storms. As these lightning storms sweep through. literally thousands of strikes occur. and hundreds of fires can be set in one evening across the public lands of the West. As I mentioned. the 2006 fire season broke several records. including acreage. By the end of this week. we will have surpassed that increase as it relates to time and place of the fire season. We have obviously not yet burned the 10 million acres of last year. but by measurement this fire season is now worse. Almost 100 years ago. the Forest Service started something. They started with a commitment and a philosophy to full fire suppression. Now I take you to a little bit of history as to what may be producing the very dramatic fire sbason we experienced last year and the year before. and we are now experiencing today. During that time. the Forest Services aim was to extinguish every fire. manmade or lightning caused. With the exception of the last 15 years. the timber industry. on our public lands. enjoyed booming success during the same period. So while Mother Nature was not allowed to burn the forest. man was allowed to come in over the last 100 years and thin and clean. We called it logging. That produced the timber for the home and building industries. As a result. it is arguable that wildfires were kept somewhat under control. Not only did we put the fires out. but we were taking the fuels off the land. % In the 1990s. during the Clinton years. as a result of the impact of a variety of public policies. from the Endangered Species Act to the New Forest Management Act to the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. and a lot of other combinations. we began to progressively reduce the overall cut of timber on public lands. In the 8 years of Bill Clinton. we reduced the allowable cut. Here are the figures on this chart. It is patterned by revenue flow. We reduced .the allowable cut of timber on our public lands by 80 percentnot 8 percent. by well over 80 percent. So if you follow the green line on this chart. you follow the revenue flow that was coming from our public lands through the U.S. Forest Service. Of course. it was during that time that the Forest Service had money. As a result. they haTfthe money to fight the fires. Then you see the decline on the chart. As we discontinued timber harvests on our public lands. the reveiiue no longer was produced. But something else was happening. We were leavingon our public lands dramatic increases in timber and brush and. in todays situation. fuel for the fires. So in part. the West is burning today because of public policy. because of attitude. not because of Mother Nature. Mother Nature has ebbed and flowed over time. But when Mother Nature is taken out of balance by mans practices and policies. dramatic results can occur. As the revenues declined and they paralleled human activity on the public lands. dramatic increases in fire resulted. What do we do about it? For the last several years I have stood on the Senate floor and participated in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and chaired the Forestry Subcommittee for many of these years and have said openly and publicly: We. by our public policy. have destroyed the U.S. Forest Service. We bankrupted it. It no longer has any money. In so doing. we keep putting greater burden on it. and we wont fund it. We are not in the habit of funding it because timber sales historically funded the U.S. Forest Service. It not only funded all of their practices. both logging and trail clearing and wildlife management and habitat control. it did something else: It put money into the U.S. Treasury. We ""created a unique balance over the last 100 years beQause you cant predict a fire season. You have the revenue flow coming in. So we simply borrowed the money to fight fires from the different accounts of the U.S. Forest Service and at the end of the year. when the fire season was over and all the bills were paid. we simply replenished all of the accounts of the U.S. Forest Service that it used to manage the different components of the Forest Service itself. It no longer happens today. We are still borrowing money from accounts to fight fires. but there is no money in the accounts. At the end of the year. because of tight budgets. we dont replenish the money from the general fund of the U.S. Government. There is no money there. Timber receipts used to fund the money. used to create the balance. used to do a lot of things. They no longerexist. in large part because of public policy. What is happening in Idaho and across the West at this moment. when you see the valleys full of smoke and the mountains full of smoke and the skies with dark bands of carbonfilled air across the West. our natural resources are literally going up in smoke. What is burning out there are trees. It is also watersheds and water quality and wildlife habitat. All of that is disappearing in a ball of fire. and it should not be that way.. What are the solutions? Throwing more money at fire suppression? Well. we have been doing that- by ever increasing amounts every year for the last 5 or 6 years. to the tune of billions of dollars annually. I am the ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. I put in another half billion dollars to fight fires. and it will quickly go up in smoke at the rate the fires are burning in the West. What is the solution? More activemanagement? Yes. More active management on our public lands will help the fire -situation because active managementif you look at the Healthy Forests Act we passed several years agomeans you are in there thinning. you are in there cleaning the underbrush. you are doing the kind of things that fire would have done naturally 100 years ago. But we changed the circumstance. and we changed the environment. Fire is unique in that it can be beneficial if it is handled appropriately. If you have 100 trees per acre. and fire is allowed to amble through and burn out all of the underbrush. it does not kill the tree. in many instances. But if you have 400 trees per acre of the kind we have allowed to happen over the last good number of decades. then it burns everything because the fire is so intense by the volume of fuel on the forest floor. That is a circumstance the West is experiencing. as we speak.

391076,"Madam Speaker. today I am introducing a revised bill to designate as wilderness most of the lands within the Rocky Mountain National Park and to expand the Indian Peaks Wilderness. The bill is cosponsored by my Colorado colleague. Representative MUSGRAVE. and an identical measure is being introduced in the other body by Colorados two Senators. Over a period of months. we have worked together to develop this bipartisan legislation that will provide important protection and management direction for some truly remarkable country. adding well over 200.000 acres in the park to the National Wilderness Preservation System. The wilderness designation for the park will cover some 94 percent of the park. including Longs Peaks and other major mountains along the Great Continental Divide. glacial cirques and snow fields. broad expanses of alpine tundra and wet meadows. oldgrowth forests. and hundreds of lakes and streams. all untrammeled by human structures or passage. Indeed. examples of all the natural ecosystems that make up the splendor of the. Park are included in the wilderness that would be designated by this bill. At the same time. the wilderness boundaries have been drawn so as to allow continued access for use of existing roadways. buildings and developed areas. privately owned land. and areas where additional facilities and roadwork will improve park management and visitor services. In addition. specific provisions are included to assure that there ill be no adverse effects on continued use of existing water facilities. The lands designated as wilderness will become part of the National Wilderness Preservation System that was established by the Wilderness Act and will be managed in accordance with that Act and the provisions of the bill. The bills provisions amplify this by specitying that-(1) no new reclamation projects will be allowed in the wilderness area. (2) nothing in the bill will create a ""buffer zone"" around the wilderness and that nonwildemess activities visible or audible from within the wilderness will not be prohibited. (3) the National Park Service can act to control fire. insects. and diseases. including use of mechanical tools within the wilderness. and (4) nothing in the bill will reduce or restrict the current authority of the National Park Service to manage the Parks lands and resources. The bill is similar to measures previously introduced by my predecessor. Representative David Skaggs (as well as others introduced before that). and ones I introduced in the 107th. 108th. and 109th Congress. However. it does include a number of adjustments and refinements that reflect discussion within the Colorado delegation in Congress and with interested parties in Colorado. Like H.R. 4935 of the 109th Congress. the new bill includes designation of wilderness designation of more than 700 acres In the Twin Sisters area south of Estes Park. These lands Were acquired by the United States and E1052 May 15. 2007 CONGRE made part of the park after submission to Congress of the original wilderness recommendation for the park in the 1970s. and so were not included in that recommendation. They are lands of a wilderness character and their designation will not conflict with any current uses. On the west side. the town of Grand Lake and Grand County requested that about 650 acres inward from the Park boundary around the town be omitted from the wildemess designation in order to allow the Park to respond to .potential forest fire threats. As was the case previously. this bill accommodates that request. Also like that previous measure. the bill responds to the request of the Town of Grand Lake. Grand County and the Headwaters Trails Alliance (a group composed of local communities in Grand County that seeks to establish opportunities for mountain biking) and the International Mountain Bicycling Association to omit from wilderness designation an area along the western park boundary. running south along Lake Granby from the Town to the parks southern boundary. This will allow the National Park Service to retain the option of authorizing construction of a possible future mountain bike route within this part of the park. Similarly. the bill would expand the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area by 1.000 acres in the area south of the park and north of Lake Granby. The lands involved are currently managed as part of the Arapaho National Recreation Area. which would accordingly be reduced by about 1.000 acres. As did the previous bill. this bill includes a section that will authorize the National Park Service to lease an 11acre property (the Leiffer tract) that was donated to the National Park Service in 1977. Located outside the parks boundaries. it has two buildings. including a house that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Park Service would like to have the option of leasing it. but current law allows that only for ""property -administered . . . as part of the National Park System."" and this property does not qualify. The bill would allow the Park Service to lease the property as if it were located inside or contiguous to the park. Also like previous measures. the bill addresses the question of possible impacts on water rightssomething that can be a primary point of contention in Congressional debates over designating wilderness areas. It reflects the legal reality that it has long been recognized under the laws of the United States and Colorado. including a decision of the Colorado Supreme Court. that Rocky Mountain National Park already has extensive Federal reserved water rights arising from the creation of the national park itself. And it reflects the geographic reality that the park sits astride the continental divide. meaning theres no higher land around from which streams flow into the park. and thus there is no possibility of any diversion of water occurring upstream from the park. In recognition of these legal and practical realities. the bill includes a finding that because the park already has these extensive reserved rights to water. there is no need fo any additional reservation or appropriation of such right. and- an explicit disclaimer that the bill effects any such reservation. New provisions in this bill deal with the Grand River Ditch. created before Rocky Mountain National Park was established and partly located within the park. The owners of SSIONAL RECORD- Extensions o the ditch are currently working to conclude an agreement with the National Park Service with respect to operation and maintenance of the portion of the ditc within the park. and the bill provides that after conclusion of this agreement the strict liability standard of the Park Resources Protection Act (which now applies to any damage to park resources) will not apply so long as the ditch is operated and maintained in accordance with the agreement. The owners of the ditch would remain liable for damage to park resources caused by negligence or intentional acts. and the bill specifies that it will not limit or otherwise affect the liability of any individual or entity for damages to. loss of. or injury to any park resource resulting from any cause of event occurring before the bills enactment. In addition. the bill specifies that its enactment will not restrict or otherwise affect any activity relating to the monitoring. operation.. maintenance. repair. replacement. or use of the ditch that was authorized or approved by the National Park Service as of the date. of the bills enactment. And the bill also provides that use of water transported by the ditch for a main purpose (or main purposes) other than irrigation will not terminate or adversely affect the ditchs rightofway. Madam Speaker. the matters dealt with in this bill have a long history. The wilderness designations are based on National Park Service recommendations presented to Congress by President Richard Nixon. That they have not been acted on before this reflects the difficult history of wilderness legislation. One Colorado statewide wilderness bill was enacted in 1980. but it took more than a decade before the Colorado delegation and the Congress were finally able. in 1993. to pass a second statewide national forest wilderness bill. Since then. action has been completed on bills designating wilderness in the Spanish Peaks area of the San Isabel National Forest as well as in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. the Gunnison Gorge. the Black Ridge portion of the Colorado Canyons National Conservation Area. and the James Peak area of the ArapahoRoosevelt National Forests. We now need to continue making progress by providing wilderness designations for other deserving lands in Colorado. including lands that are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. And the time is ripe for finally resolving the status of the lands within Rocky Mountain National Park that are dealt with in this bill. Lands covered by the bill are currently being managed protect their wilderness character. Formal wilderness designation will no longer leave this question to the discretion of the Park Service. but will make it clear that within the designated areas there will never be roads. visitor facilities. or other manmade features that interfere with the spectacular natural beauty and wildness of the mountains. This is especially important for a park like Rocky Mountain. which is relatively small by westem standards. As nearby land development and alteration has accelerated in recent years. the pristine nature of the parks backcountry becomes an increasingly rare feature of Colorados landscape. Further. the parks popularity demands definitive and permanent protection for wild areas against possible pressures for development within the park. While only about one tenth the size of Yellowstone National Park. Rocky Mountain sees nearly the same number of visitors each year as f Remarks E1053 does our first national park. At the same time. designating these carefully selected portions of Rocky Mountain as wilderness will make other areas. now restricted under interim wilderness protection management. available for overdue improvements to park roads and visitor facilities. In summary. Madam Speaker. this bill will protect some of our Nations finest wild lands. It will protect existing rights. It will not limit any existing opportunity for new water development. It is bipartisan and will affirm the commitment of all Coloradans to preserving the features that make our State such a remarkable place to live. So. I think it deserves prompt enactment. For the information of our colleagues I am attaching a summary of the legislation:",43,43_wilderness_park_lands_monument,"['wilderness', 'park', 'lands', 'monument', 'land', 'parks', 'acres', 'recreation', 'forest', 'trails']",wilderness - park - lands - monument - land - parks - acres - recreation - forest - trails,1,TRUE,1100046582
392119,Mr. President. I come to the floor this morning to speak about an amendment we will be voting on in probably an hour and a half. It is amendment No. 2662. which has to do with the expansion of a training facility in my State of Colorado called the Pinon Canyoh Maneuver Site. It is a training facility associated with Fort Carson. In February of 2007. a few months ago. the U.S. Army made an announcement it would move forward with an effort to acquire an additional 400.000 acresplus of land in my State to add to this training facility. What I am asking my colleagues to do today is to join with me and a vast bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives in saying we need a timeout before we move forward. I ask my Democratic and Republican colleagues to join us in supporting amendment No. 2662. I say to everyone in this Chamber and to those who are listening. if you care about private property rights. you will support this amendment. If you care about ranchers and farmers in America. including those who make a living in southeastern Colorado. you will support this amendment: If you care about being wise in terms of how we spend taxpayers dollars in expanding our military facilities. you will support this amendment. I wish to make a few remarks about its history. to put this -into perspective. First. the Army in 1982 acquired 235.000 acres for the training facility now known as Pinon Canyon. That facility has been used since 1982. It is an integral component of the training capabilities for Fort Carson. CO. In 2005. the BRAC Commission. in its recommendations which were approved in the Senate. recommendations which I supported. added additional troops to Fort Carson. The findings of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission said that Fort Carson had sufficient training facilities to -provide all the training that is needed for our troops stationed at Fort Carson. So the first question to be asked by all those who are going to be impacted by this 400.000acre expansion is whether that amount of land is sufficient to carry on the training purpose required at Fort Carson. That question simply has not been answered. If the Army moves forward with the expansion of the additional 400.000plus acres. we will have a Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in Colorado that will have 1.235 square miles. That is an area that is bigger than the size of theState of Rhode Island. Yet what the Army has proposed to do is acquire that land through condemnation or whatever necessary means to move forward with an unjustified need for an expansion of Pinon Canyon. I am not saying we ought not look at whether we need to have additional training facilities at Fort Carson. We certainly should take a look at that. But until we get the answers as to what has changed from January of 2005 until 2007 that requires the expansion of this training facility so we have a training facility the size of Rhode Islandplus. it is important we ask questions of the Army. I ask my colleagues to join us in moving forward with a timeout. with a 1year moratorium on the EIS process which the Army has proposed. and during that 1 year we can ask some very important questions that will be important to those who will be. most affectedthe residents of southeastern Colorado. We need to ask those questions as well for the men and women in uniform. whom we train at Fort Carson and around our country. to be sure we have appropriate and adequate training facilities for them. Those are questions that do need to be asked. The Department of Defense authorization and appropriations bills will be coming up. and I -have proposed and will introduce legislation that will be cosponsored by my colleague. Senator ALLARD. where we get those questions answered. When we have those questions answered. then we can make a thoughtful decision about how best to move forwardin a manner that. first. enhances and protects the national security of the United States. No. 2. make sure we are protecting the private property rights of the ranchers who have lived in this area forsometimes three and four generations. and No. 3. the investments we make with respect to any expansion of Pinon Canyon are investments that make sense from a fiscal point of view. I ask my colleagues. when we get to mendment No. 2662 in about an hour. hat they vote in support of this amendment. I conclude by saying there are two values that have driven me in my discussions on this issue of. the expansion of Pinon Canyon over the last several months. The first of those values is we need to make sure we are providing the necessary training facilities for our soldiers at Fort Carson and those who will train at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. We need to make sure we are doing that. and we have a set of questions that need to be answered in that regard. Second. we need to be sure we are protecting private property rights. When one thinks about the fact that in these 400plus acres. there are many ranchers who have been there for three and four generations. ranchers who have come to me with tears in their eyes. who talk about the fact that their wife is buried on their ranch and that they took the ranch from their father and their mother and from their grandparents. it seems to me that if there is an opportunity for us to make sure we are protecting private property rights. this is a time for us to say we are going to protect the private property rights of those ranchers. I say to my colleagues. I am not asking for the death knell to be put on any proposed expansion by the Army. All I am asking is that we have -a 1year timeout. a 1year delay so we can get these fundamental questions answered on how we move forward with Pinon Canyon. I urge my colleagues to please support amendment No. 2662 when we vote on it in about an hour. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD letters in support of my amendment and the position on the Pinon Canyon issue from Otero County. a resolution from Huerfano County. Las Animas County. Colorado Counties. Inc.. LaJunta. the Bent County Commissioners. Baca County Commissioners. the Club 20. Action 22.

406175,"Mr. Speaker. I want to welcome my colleagues from Oregon who are in the Chamber with me tonight. Congressman DEFAZIO and Congresswoman DARLENE HOOLEY are here with me. and I know we will be joined by other members of the Northwest delegation to talk about a very. very important issue. the Secure Rural Schools and Community SelfDetermination Act. H.R. 17. also known as County Payments. that in both this Congress and the last has been a strongly bipartisan issue. The DeFazioWalden legislation. H.R. 17. a bill to reauthorize and fund the County Payments Program for 7 years to date enjoys the support of 114 cosponsors in this Congress. The exact same bill last Congress had 139 cosponsors. As I have said in 13 of 18 oneminute floor speeches: the failure of Congress. either the last one or this one. to reauthorize the County Payments Program amounts to a breach of faith to more than 600 forested counties all across America and 4.400 school districts all across this country. I would like to take a moment to highlight a few of the impacts of the rural forested counties and school districts in America without these funds: severe cuts in funding for jail beds. sheriffs patrols are being cut sometimes in half. criminal prosecutions and the pursuit of meth cooks. all of that being reduced. rural school districts foregoing overdue repairs. may not be able to buy textbooks. or face significant challenges busing kids to schools. It also means libraries will close in places like Jackson County. Oregon. I would like to draw .your attention to This poster here to my left. It is from a young lady. a fifth grader named Alice from Ashland. Oregon. who utilizes one of the 15 Jackson County libraries where she lives. and they are all scheduled to close in just a couple of months. in April. if we dont reauthorize and fund the Secure County Schools legislation. Alice has resolved to read all the ""Hank the Cowdog"" books. but she needs these libraries to stay open. She says: ""Representative WALDEN. I. live in Ashland and I go to Bellview School. I am in the fifth grade. I use our library a lot. We always use books on tape for car trips. My New Years resolution is to read all the ""Hank the Cowdog"" books. and the library has them all. I need thelibrary to stay open so I can finish my resolution. I also use a lot of books here for school reports. Please help to keep our library system open. Sincerely. Alice."" Alice is a fifth grader in Ashland. Oregon. She gets it. If Alice can get it. this Congress ought to be able to get it. and we ought to be able to keep the libraries open in Jackson County. Many of .you in this Chamber and Americans all across the land will remember the heartwrenching service for the Kim family in southern Oregon this winter. lost in the national forest. and the mountain climbers who perished on Mount Hood just 45 minutes from my home in Hood River. Both of these counties. both of the search and rescue operations that took place used funds out- of the program that Congressman DEFAZIO and others and I are trying to reauthorize to help pay for the equipment and for the search and rescue operations. to go on Federal land using county resources to look for these people who were lost. some of whom perished. These vital county services and rural school programs were once funded by timber receipts. but because of virtual elimination of the timber harvest on our Federal forests. Congress approved the county payments to develop forest health improvement projects on public lands and simultaneously stimulate job development in some of our rural communities. (2 2100 This law has been a primary funding mechanism to provide rural schools with educational opportunities comparable to suburban and urban students. It has also restored programs for students in rural schools and prevented the closure of numerous isolated rural schools. It has allowed over 600 rural counties to address the severe road maintenance backlog. Before I get into that. though. I would like to show you total Pacific Northwest timber receipts. As you can see here. it has fluctuated over the years. but it has never been as low as it is today. There were big years of timber harvest. this one up. very large. but generally it has been in this framework. and you can see. really. since the 1990s it has just gone way down. The Federal Government has had a compact with these counties dating back to when Teddy Roosevelt was President and created the great forest reserves. setting aside huge swaths of land. Upwards to half of my district is under Federal management and control. and many of my colleagues and some of my counties it is upwards to 70. 75 percent. The Federal Government believed in 1908 and again in 1938 that it had a responsibility to help these communities surrounded by Federal lands because these lands were not going to be on their- tax base. That is what started this whole program. They used to share timber receipts. As you can see. timber harvests went down. the receipts went dawn. You say. what happened to our wood products system? Well. here is what happened. See what happened on Federal forest lands. This is 1980 here. top level. about 11 billion board feet sold. Then it drops way down in the red. Where did we get the lumber? Imports. Soft wood lumber imports right there. the blue and the yellow. So this came -along. we said timber receipts are down. so we are going to replace it. 6 years ago. now almost 7. We authorized this. Secure Rural Schools and Community SelfDetermination Act. The country has 7.500 national forests . and grasslands covering 192 million acres. That is the size of Texas. by the way. Our State of Oregon has 15 national forests. We are proud of them. You need to know they cover 14 million acres. or nearly onequarter of the States land mass. There are forests in my district that cover nearly 12 million acres. To put this in perspective. within the Forest Service regions 8and 9. which cover 34 States. all States east of the Missouri .River. Oklahoma and Texas. there are 52 national forests covering 25 million acres. My district alone has nearly half that amount of acreage. You can see those of us in the ruralWest are really impacted by what goes on in the Federal lands. whether it is search and rescue operations. forest fire operations. You name it. it is expensive. When the Federal reserves were created. we set up this funding mechanism. again going back to 1908 and then coming forward. The problem now is promise to rural schools. the promise to rural communities. and the promise to rural roads has been broken. It broke last year. and it is up to us now in this Congress to keep the faith with the school kids of America and rural America. to keep faith with the resource advisory committees. They are bringing environmentalists and others together to improve forest health and habitat. great projects all over the country. to keep faith with basiccounty services that are being provided. funded by this program. Folks. last checks went out the end of the year. What is happening now is the pink slips.are going out. Road departments are being cut in half. County sheriffs departments are being cut in half. School teachers getting pink slips. being told. we are not sure we will have the money to hire you back next year. This is now a crisis. and it is time for Congress to act.

421486,According to the Army. theSalazar amendment is too restrictive. It prevents them from doing anything on Pinon Canyon to resolve even their differences with the farmers and ranchers. including photocopying handouts or maps to the citizens with questions. holding community meetings to find common ground. and even doing a required environmental impact statement. Senator SALAZAR and I have offered amendments to -ast years and this years Defense authorization bill to address many of the valid issues raised by concerned citizens and elected officials whose communities are affected by the proposed expansion of Pinon Canyon. the need for any .expansion of Pinon Canyon by the Army. and the economic and environmental impact to southeastern Colorado. I agree with my colleague that the Army needs to answer questions. I agree we need to ensure the residents and communities impacted by any expansion are part of the process and their concerns are addressed. I believe this amendment would not accomplish those goals but. rather. actually keep us from -getting needed answers to which they are entitled. Where we disagree is on the approach. This amendment will have longterm unintended consequences we could regret. I ask my colleagues to consider those consequences before they vote.

426450,"Mr. President. today I wish to honor the service of the Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent. Joe Alston. who is retiring this week. Joe is a man of considerable integrity. ability. and achievement. and his presence at the Grand Canyon will be deeply missed. After 31 dedicated years. Joe Alston is retiring from the National Park Service. He has spent the last 6 years serving as the superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park. the crown jewel of Arizona and one of the Nations oldest and most heavily visited National Parks. Joe has held a wide variety of positions in the Park Service beginning with his first job as a seasonal firefighter on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. In the years that followed. Joe worked as a concessions specialist at Yellowstone National Park and later became the chief of the Concessions Management Division in the Alaska Regional Office. More recently. Joe Alston was the assistant superintendent of Yellowstone National Park and eventually served as superintendent at several major National Park units such as the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. the Curecanti National Recreation Area. the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. and the Rainbow Bridge National Monument. We are very fortunate to have benefited from the passion and expertise that Superintendent Alston brought to the Grand Canyon. Joe was challenged with many complex issues and longstanding conflicts ranging from park transportation to aircraft overflights. yet he has managed them all with foresight. thoughtfulness. and resolve. Under Joes leadership. the Park Service saw the completion of the Colorado River Management Plan. which protects park resources by implementing a new river permitting system that balances competing commercial and recreational interests. Despite its highly contentious nature. it was Superintendent Alstons desire to hear and understand the views of river runners and other constituents by affording the public every opportunity to provide input during the CRMP planning process. Few superintendents in National Park Service history have undertaken such an open nationwide approach that concluded with such remarkable success. The Grand Canyon has received many honors during Superintendent Alstons tenure. In 2004. Grand Canyon National Park was recognized for a number of environmental accomplishments by EPA Administrator Mike Leavitt. including having the first EPA certified Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ""green building"" owned and operated in a National Park. Joe was the driving force behind the implementation of new training programs that led to the reduction of visitor and employee injuries which earned the Park the Regional Directors Safety Excellence Award and the Directors Safety Excellence Award for Public Safety Achievement in 2005. Among the many accolades Joe has received over the years. perhaps the most noteworthy came in 2005 when Secretary Gale Norton awarded him the Meritorious Service Award. the second highest honorary recognition granted to Interior Department employees. Joe Alstons ties to the Grand Canyon extend beyond his outstanding professional career. Indeed. the Grand Canyon also happens to be where he met his wife. Judy. who is a teacher with the Grand Canyon Public Schools System. Joe is regarded by those living in northern Arizona as an individual deeply connected to the community. Just last month. he accepted the Community Person of the Year award from the Grand Canyon Rotary Club for ushering in a new era of partnership between the communities of Tusayan. AZ. and Grand Canyon National Park. My son and I had the distinct pleasure of hiking the Grand Canyon rim to rim last year with the accompaniment of Joe Alston. I can think of few others alive today who are as knowledgeable and devoted to the history and culture of thb Grand Canyon than Superintendent Alston. I wish Joe the very best in his future goals and ambitions.*",4821,4821_park_superintendent_spirtes_ranger,"['park', 'superintendent', 'spirtes', 'ranger', 'canyon', 'dale', 'tollefson', 'parks', 'nps', 'galvin']",park - superintendent - spirtes - ranger - canyon - dale - tollefson - parks - nps - galvin,1,TRUE,1100010531

434352,"Mr. President. today I am introducing the No Child Left Inside Act of 2007. which will provide new support for environmental education in our Nations classrooms. Given the major environmental challenges we face today. teaching our young people about their natural world should be a priority. and this legislation is an important first step. For more than three decades. environmental education has been a growing part of effective instruction in Americas schools. Responding to the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the 21st century economy. many schools throughout the Nation now offer some form of environmental education. Mr. President. 30 million students and 1.2 million teachers annually are involved in these programs. Yet. environmental education is facing a significant challenge. Many schools are being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental programs. Fewer and fewer students are able to take part in related classroom instruction and field investigations.- however effective or popular. State and local administrators. teachers. and environmental educators point to two. factors behind this recent and disturbing shift: the unintended consequences of the No Child Left Behind Act and a lack of funding for these critical programs. The legislation that I am introducing today would address these two causes. It would provide funding to States to train their teachers in the field of environmental education. and it would provide support for outdoor environmental education programs for children and a model environmental education curriculum. The bill would also create incentives. through new funding. for states to develop environmental literacy plans to make sure students have a solid understanding of our planet and its precious natural resources. Finally. the legislation would reestablish the Office of Environmental Education within the U.S. Department of Education to oversee critical environmental education activities. This legislation has broad support among national and state environmental groups and educational groups. The American public recognizes that the environment is already one of the dominant issues of the 21st century. In 2003. a National Science Foundation panel noted that ""in the coming decades. the public will more frequently be called upon to understand complex environmental issues. assess risk. evaluate proposed environmental plans and understand how individual decisions affect the environment at local and global scales. Creating a scientifically informed citizenry requires a concereed. systemic approach to environmental education ..."" In the private sector. business leaders also increasingly believe that an environmentally literate workforce is critical to their longterm success. They recognize that better. more efficient environmental practices.improve the bottom line and help position their companies for the future. Climate change. conservation of. precious natural resources. maintaining clean air and water. and other environmental challenges are pressing and complex issues that influence human health. economic development and national security. Finding widespread agreement about the specific steps we need to take to solve these problems is difficult. Environmental education will help ensure that our Nations children have the knowledge and skills necessary to address these critical issues. In short. the environment should be an important part of the curriculum in our schools. I know my constituents in Rhode Island. as well as the residents of other States. want their children to be environmentally literate and have a connection with the natural world. I am proud to sponsor this important legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the No Child Left Inside Act of 2007. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record..",2761,2761_environmental_sustainability_steinbrenner_farmingdale,"['environmental', 'sustainability', 'steinbrenner', 'farmingdale', 'green', 'ecklund', 'apecs', '3036', 'ohlone', 'sustainable']",environmental - sustainability - steinbrenner - farmingdale - green - ecklund - apecs - 3036 - ohlone - sustainable,1,TRUE,1100087927
434820,Mr. President. another bill dealing with the large military presence in Colorado relates to the expansion of the Armys Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. Due to an emphasis on rapid mobility. modularity. and ma= neuverability in recent years. the Armys ability to project force across the battlefield has increased exponentially. As such. the Army transformation is also driving higher their requirement for training space. With its close location to Fort Carson. Pinon Canyon was perfectly suited for the Armys training .needs 20 years ago. However. with the arrival of 10.000 new soldiers to Fort Carson. the Army has determined that the size of the site needs to be increased in order to meet Fort Carsons new operational training requirements. I have been told repeatedly by Army officials that the genesis of Fort Carsons expansion proposal occurred when several landowners approached Fort Carson and expressed their strong desire to sell. I also understand that sufficient numbers of willing sellers exist to support a significant expansion of the site. However. many in the community surrounding Pinon Canyon have major questions that need to be answered. In order to get some of these major questions answered. a reporting requirement was placed in the 2006 Defense Authorization bill. approved by both the Senate and the House. However. the Department of Army is restricted on communicating about any specific land acquisition proposal until a waiver for that site has been granted by the Secretary of Defense. which has yet to be granted. Thus. the Armys hands were tied and they were unable to meet the full .reporting requirements in the 2006 JDefense authorization. I understand the difficult position the Army is on this issue. but I believe it is absolutely necessary that they provide the information to the community and to Congress prior to any acquisition of property. The leadership at Fort Carson has done a great job of reaching out and providing what information it could to the local communities. However. the Pentagon has not been as forthcoming. I believe the Congregs and. more importantly. the local communities in Southeastern Colorado need more information before we can decide whether this proposed expansion is necessary and appropriate. With these objectives in mind. today I am introducing a bill that clearly defines the process under which the Army can expand the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site. This legislation prohibits the use of eminent domain. requires the Army to pay fair market value. Most importantly. the bill does not allow the Army to proceed with land acquisition until it delivers the answers previously sought on the environmental and economic impacts of expansion and also must offer options for compensating the loss of property tax revenue. * It is vital that the Army take the time to answer these important questions to help alleviate the affected communities concerns. A number .of counties and small towns in Southeastern Colorado could be adversely affected by this expansion. and this study will help us better understand the extent of these impacts and provide options for mitigating them.

459352,"Mr. President. gas prices this summer could easily be triple what they were when President Bush took office. The dramatic increase in oil prices brought prices for food up along with it. and families are facing a painful financial choice when it comes time to fill their gas tank: Put a gallon of gas in the car or put a gallon of milk on the kitchen table. When Americans are paying this much to fill their gas tanks. it is a drain on the whole economy. Businesses are cutting jobs. families have already eliminated nonessentials. and many are now cutting back on meals. Some people are even contemplating changing their job because they cant afford the gas to get to work. It has become painfully clear that we are in an oil crisis. Some of the forces driving up prices are beyond immediate controlsuch as the demand from China and India. But some of the factors offer opportunities for action. First. market experts have testified before Congress that speculators are driving up prices far beyond where the natural forces of supply and demand should take them. Second. we can take steps in this country to reduce our demand and our dependence on foreign oil. Last week in the Senate. Democrats brought legislation forward that would attack some of the root causes of the skyrocketing price of oil. cut down gas prices that are artificially high. and bring relief to drivers at the pump. That bill. the ConsumerFirst Energy Act. would have provided that relief by. among other things. ensuring that our commodities markets are functioning fairly so prices can come down from their artificial highs. The supplyanddemand equation is roughly the same as it was 2 years ago. Yet we have seen prices go through the roof. Experts say speculation could be adding anywhere between $50 and $80 a barrel to the price of oil. In some respects. I am not surprised this is the one place in the market that doesnt seem to be regulated. We can see what happened under the administration of a President and Vice President whose politics have always been tied up with the oil companies for whom they used to work. Here you have the price of a barrel of oil that has risen from about $20 a barrel when President Bush took office to about $140 a barrel right now. As we have seen that price rise. what happens? As the price of oil has risen. the profits of big oil companies have risenfrom about $20 billion when President Bush took office to about $120 billion right now. The price of oil goes up and profits go up as well. And as the profits have risen for big oil. the price of gas that we pay at the pump has risenfrom under $1.50 a gallon when President Bush took office. in many cases. to. in some cases. over $4 per gallon right now. The ConsumerFirst Energy Act would have made sure that oil is traded on a wellregulated. transparent market free from manipulation. But my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle said no to that legislation. They said no to the American consumer because they obviously feel committed to say yes to big oil. Yesterday. once again. the Senate had the chance to help free our country from the liquid shackles of foreign oil. The Baucus substitute amendmenthad we been able to offer it. had we not been stopped by our Republican colleagueswould have spurred the development of renewable energy by providing almost $20 billion in tax incentives for investment in the production. transportation. and conservation of energy. In order to encourage renewable energy industries to build to the scale we need them to. we have to send renewable producers the clear message that their product will have continued support in the future. So the bill would have extended investment tax credits for 6 years to ensure the continued development of solar energy. fuel cells. and microturbines. among others. We have seen how important this is in my home State of New Jersey where the solar industry has created thousands of jobs and helped ""green"" the Garden State. The bill would have encouraged the production of cellulosic biofuels. including cellulosic ethanol. It would have encouraged the development and use of biodiesel and renewable diesel. encouraged further investments in advanced technology vehicles. and created a tax credit for alternative refueling stations so that the infrastructure exists in our country to make those vehicles viable. . So in the face of a broadbased package to encourage new green energy sources that would have helped bring down gas prices and end our dependence on foreign oil. what did my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle say? They said no again. Republicans said no to helping American consumers because they could not help but say yes to big oil. It is no surprise then when my distinguished colleague from Arizona. Senator MCCAIN. delivered his big energy speech yesterday. where did he do it? He did it in the oil capital of the United States. The big plan President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress are pushing is hnother example of big oil writing our energy policy. as they have done for the last 8 years. And Senator McCAMN repeats it. That plan comes down to one thing: Drilling. drilling. drilling along the coasts of our country. When JoHN MCCAIN or George Bush talk about opening our coastline to drilling. they make it sound like gasoline is going to gush out from that drill straight out of the ground and right into your car. What they either do not want to tell the public or simply ignore is that. in fact. it will take at least a decadea decadeto see any production out of these areas. and even then. the Energy Information Department tells us this will be a drop in the bucketV Why give the oil companies another handout when they are sitting on 68 million acres of land leased from the American people which they have yet to explore? I find it hard to believe that Senator MCCAIN would say the Federal Government discourages offshore oil production when more than 80 percent of the oil that is offshore is already open for production. and oil companies own more than 30 millioii acres of leases in Federal waters they have not usedthat they have not used. The vast majority of oil and natural gas resources on Federal land is already open for drilling. and it is not being tapped. Currently. oil companies are not producing oil or gas on 68 million of the more than 91 million acres of Federal land under their control. And 31 million of those 68 million acres are offshore. Offshore. these companies are producing on only about 20 percent of the acres they hold. while onshore they are producing less than 30 percent of the acres they hold. So one has to wonder. when big oil pushes relentlessly for more and more land and water to drill. even when they have millions of acres they have yet to use. it makes us wonder if they are not just exploiting this oil crisis to expand the reserves on their books in order to inflate their share price. Certainly. the needs of American consumers are not what these CEOs are looking out for. If the Senate does not act now. billions of dollars. worth of research and development tax credits will expire. impeding innovation and discovery. As the world becomes increasingly globalized and technology driven. we must increase our investments in research and development in order to maintain our position as a world leader in the 21st century. If the Senate does not act. billions of dollars invested in alternative. clean sources of energy will cease. and so will our progress to become energy independent. I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle decry the rising price of gas and talk about developing alternative sources of energy. But when they had the opportunity yesterday. once again they said no. as they said no last week on having market speculation taken out of the price of oil. therefore the price of gas. By the way. what would have been offered yesterday had we been able to proceedand hopefully we can proceed on todayis that millions of Americans subject to the alternative minimum tax. placing unfair and unnecessary tax increases on middleclass families. could have gotten a break under the Baucus substitute. That is all that would have been able to happen. Finally. here is the bigger picture. We have 2 percent of this worlds oil reserves. and we consume 25 percent of the worlds oil. We are never going to meet growing domestic demand with shrinking domestic supply. The only way to make these numbers balance is to reduce our dependence on oil by increasing production of renewable fuels. If we are going to have a secure energy future. there is a lot more we need to do to explore besides oil reserves. We had better start exploring the outer reaches of our creativity. not lining the inner pockets of the corporate oil elite. It is time to say yes to tapping our industriousness. harnessing our powers of innovation. and summoning up the will to change. that change that has made this country great. We have an opportunity to break our dependence. We have an opportunity to tell the oil companies. too. by the way: Pursue the 68 million acres of land and water you already have licenses and leases for and stop telling.us to go potentially risk our environmentally sensitive areas in pursuit of oil that will not be achieved for a decade. will not do anything about gas prices today. when you are not even moving on the 68 million acres to which you already have access. Ultimately. all it would do is increase your profits. but it would cause States. such as my State of New Jersey. where tourism is the second largest driver of its economy. to risk the possibility of an oil spill on the shores of New Jerseys beaches and kill billions of dollars that annually are generated as a result of that. So I do not want to hear from the capital of big oil. our dear colleague and the presumptive Republican nominee tell us the solution to our problem is to drill more. when 68 million acres that the big oil companies have are already not being pursued. when ultimately it will not produce a penny of reduction in gas prices. When we had the opportunity to make a real impact last week on the bill that would take the speculation out of the marketplace. stop price gouging. and at the same time. when we have an opportunity today. before the Senate. to make sure that we extend those renewable tax credits. give us better fuelefficient vehicles. give us better renewable energy sources. and break our addiction to the reality that the reality is that the overwhelming part of oil in this world resides not here in the United States but abroad. That is our challenge and opportunity. It is time to say yes to American consumers. time to say no to big oil.

495831,Mr. President. today I am introducing the Sustainable Revenue for Oregon Counties Act. a bill aimed at finding a sustainable longterm solution to the revenue problems faced by Oregons timberdependent counties and other timberdependent counties across our Nation. This bill. which is cosponsored by Senator RON WYDEN. will establish a task force to determine the best way to provide counties with a dependable source of revenue after the current county payments program expires. Last year I promised that county payments would be the subject of my first bill as a Senator because addressing this issue is essential to the longterm success of Oregons rural counties. Thanks to the hard work of Senator WYDEN and our congressional delekation. payflents are in place f6r the next. years: But we need to start preparing for what happens next. Let me give some background on this critical issue. Like many Western States. the Federal Government owns much of Oregons land base. More than half of Oregons land is federally owned. One class of the Federal lands is the O&C lands. These lands were granted to Oregon & California Railroad in 1866 and later reverted to the Federal Government when the railroad failed to live up to terms of the grant. They also included a class of lands that originated from a similar situation. the Ceos Bay Wagon Road lands. These O&C lands make up 2.2 million acres in western and southern Oregon. Then there are Forest Service landstimbered lands owned by the Forest Service. managedthat make up 14 million additional acres across our State. In both cases. the Federal Government has allocated a share of the revenue generated by cutting timber to compensate local counties for their services. Since 1908. in fact. the Federal Government has compensated counties for the revenue lost due to Forest Service lands with a simple formula: 25 percent of the revenue earned by harvesting timber. Since 1937 the Federal Government has sustained a similar commitment on our O&C lands. The O&C Act provided that counties receive 75 percent of the timber harvest revenues. and since 1957 that was reasserted with 50 percent going directly to the counties and. 25 percent put into management. Then along came the 1990s and something happened. What happened is. the Federal Government started saying for other reasonsenvironmental reasons. stewardship reasonswe were going to change the harvest practices on these lands. That has had a direct impact. a deep. profound impact on our timber counties. A deal was struck. In fact. in 1993. President Clinton proposed and Congress enacted a program to augment timber payments with Federal payments based on the historic harvest levels so the people of Oregons timber counties will not be paying the price for the environmental goals and other goals that were put forward. This is a deal. this is a core foundation agreement between the Federal Government and our timber counties. This program was modified in 2000 under the leadership of our senior Senator from Oregon. and the program became the Secure Rural Schools and Community SelfDetermination Act. That program. though. had a sunset in 2008 when the program disappeared that started to wreak havoc on our timberdependent counties. In Josephine County twothirds of the countys general fund came from county payments. Loss of county payments meant cutting public safety programs. Overnight. patrols were down to one 10hour shift split among six deputies covering an area the size of the State of Rhode Island. In Harney Countywhere 78 percent of the landmass. an area the size of New Jersey. is federally controlled70 percent of the road funds come from Federal payments. In Lake County. Federal land. making up 61 percent of the county. is in anticipation of losing Federal funding. so the county had to cut its Federal Road Department from 42 individuals to 1414 for a road department for a county the size of Connecticut and Delaware combined. In Jackson County. where onethird of the general fund comes from Federal payments. Jackson County eliminated 117 jobs in parks. human services. roads. public safety. and closed all of their libraries. This issue was so substantial that the Oregon Legislature. when I served as speaker. redirected more than $50 million in transportation funds away from counties under the normal formula to a formula based on the loss of the Federal timber dollars. The good news is that due to the tireless work of the senior Senator from my State. Mr. WYDEN. and our colleagues in the other Chamber. counties received. a 1year reprieve in 2007 and just last fall a 4year extension. But now we are faced again with expiration of these critical resources in 2011. So today I am here to propose a strategy to develop a coherent plan. a plan for restoring fiscal security and sustainable revenue to our counties so that. despite the crushing economic situation our counties are facing todayand unemployment is second highest in the Nation in Oregon. and in the timberdependent counties far higher than the average. many with 14. 16. 18 percent unemploymentdespite that. we need to provide a foundation for transition in 2011. There are many elements that can go into this coherent strategy. Our forests. millions of acres of second growth forests are overgrown and need to be thinned to restore forest health and prevent forest fires. Increasing the harvest could generate revenue. The material cleared from the forest could be used to generate biomass energy and cellulosic biofuels. and harvesting that material. that biomass. could generate revenue. Our forests can be used to sequester carbon. and the forests of the Northwest are potentially the largest carbon sink we have. so management to increase carbon sequestration could be a source of revenue. Increased use of public lands by visitors brings economic benefit to our counties and these recreational and tourism activities could be a source of revenues. Certainly. we need to look at the historic deal struck between the Federal Government and the counties and find a way to sustain it into the futurethat deal saying. if we are going to put restrictions on the timber harvest under these traditional timberlands that we are going to compensate counties for the lost revenue. This bill creates a task force with 15 members. Four members come from timber counties. They get their firsthand reports from the front line. One member each represents timber. conservation. recreation. and labor organizationsas well as a member from the Governors office and a member from Oregons tribes. Then the task force will be expanded to include members who are experts on sustainable forestry. on natural resource economics. on biomass energy. on carbon sequestration. and on habitat conservation. This task force is charged with developing a longterm plan to raise sustainable revenue for Oregons counties. and it will consider all of the concepts that I have mentioned. as well as others that are proposed or that come up in the course of the task forces work. They are going to report back two strategies for consideration within 9 months of this bill being enacted. Timberlands are an important part of the national economy and an extremely important part of the Oregon economy. Timber products can beused to help us address next generation biofuels. Timber can be used to sequester carbon. It is a creative. adaptable building material. and our timber .counties have been hit particularly hard by the downturn in the national housing market.

510140,"I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H. Res. 492 and urge my colleagues to support its passage. As a member of the Science and Technology Committee and as cochair of the HighPerformance Buildings Caucus. Im delighted to join my colleague and caucus cochair. Congressman Russ CARNAHAN. to recognize June 15 through June 19 as HighPerformance Building Week. By definition. a highperformance building is one that utilizes the highest design. construction. operation. and maintenance principles to address human. economic. environmental. and societal needs. Based on section 914 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. that definition is a result of significant industry and standards collaboration. Building on that coordinated effort. Representative CARNAHAN and I formed the HighPerformance Buildings Caucus last year. We wanted to heighten awareness and inform policymakers about the major impact buildings have on our health safety. and environment. Through monthly briefings. we explore .the opportunities to design. construct. and operate highperformance buildings that reflect our concern for these impacts. As the resolution states. the built environment in our country has a tremendous impact on our lives. Buildings consume 40 percent of the energy in the United States while emitting 39 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. Perhaps a more surprising statistic is that Americans average 90 percent of their time indoors. With that in mind. new building construction and sustainability of our current building inventory is more important now than ever. As we seek to use energy more efficiently and reduce global emissions. we also have to consider worker productivity in business. enhanced learning environments in schools. and even secure designs to prevent loss of life from catastrophic natural disasters. Research. design. and construction of highperformance buildings include these factors and more. Accessibility. aesthetics. historic integrity and costeffectiveness must also be considered. Madam Speaker. we could not honor the goals and ideas of HighPerformance Building Week without thanking"" those groups that have helped us get here today. Dozens of building. and standards organizations make up the HighPerformance Buildings Congressional Caucus Coalition. I know that I speak for myself and my fellow caucus cochair when I say ""thank you"" for their help educating. researching. and advancing the goals of highperformance buildings. And with that. Madam Speaker. I would submit a list of those organizations to be included in the RECORD.",7408,7408_highperformance_buildings_bullitt_building,"['highperformance', 'buildings', 'bullitt', 'building', 'design', '492', '2866', 'bren', 'insulation', 'esbl']",highperformance - buildings - bullitt - building - design - 492 - 2866 - bren - insulation - esbl,1,TRUE,1110046753

520267,Madam Speaker. I rise in support of House Resolution 492. supporting the goals and ideals of HighPerformance Building Week. and I yield myself as much time as I will consume. Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of H. Res. 492. supporting the goals and ideals of HighPerformance Building Week. I would first like to thank the Congressional HighPerformance Building Caucus cochairs. RUSS CARNAHAN and JUDY BIGGERT for their work on this important issue and for bringing awareness to the Congress and the public on the importance and benefits of highperformance buildings. This resolution declares the week of June 15 through June 19. 2009. as HighPerformance Building Week. According to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. a highperformance building is defined as a building that integrates and optimizes on a lifecycle basis all major highperformance attributes including energy conservation. environment. safety. security. durability. accessibility. costbenefit productivity. sustainability. functionality. and operational considerations. It is important to focus on making our buildings highperformance buildings for many reasons. some of which are that our homes. offices. schools. and other buildings consume 40 percent of the primary energy and 70 percent of the electricity used in the United States annually. that buildings consume about 12 percent of the potable water in this country. and that construction of buildings and the related infrastructure consume approximately 60 percent of all raw materials used in the United .States economy. Madam Speaker. I could go on. but I think you get the point. There are a lot of efficiencies to be gained by focusing on highperformance buildings. and the benefits to our society are great. Again. I commend cochairs CARNAHAN and BIGGERT for their leadership and hope that my colleagues will see the value that awareness of the benefits of the highperformance buildings will bring and support this. resolution: With that.

Congressman Russ CARNAHAN. and our colleague JUDY BIGGERT from Illinois for their leadership on this important issue and for their outstanding work as the cochairs of the HighPerformance Buildings Caucus. Buildings consume 40 percent of the energy in the United States. This. is more energy than any other sector of the economy. Deployment of highperformance buildings can reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Science and Technology Committee. I recognize the importance of energy efficiency and sustainability in the building sector. On April 28 of this year. we held a hearing entitled Pushing the Efficiency Envelope: R&D for HighPerformance Buildings. I am happy to report that we are working on legislation to address several important issues identified at this hearing. H. Res. 492 creates a greater public awareness about highperformance buildings and recognizes the need to continue research and development for innovative energyefficient technologies. I urge all Members to support H. Res.

546169,Madam Speaker. I rise today to honor Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Steve Martin. who has unselfishly given over 35 years of exceptional service to the nation as a steward of our national parks. During his years as a park ranger and superintendent. Mr. Martin has championed the mission of the National Park Service in protecting the nations many natural and cultural resources. has resolutely defended parks from degradation and harm. and has generously nurtured new generations of park employees and managers to serve as park stewards. His career encompassed exemplary service in leadership positions at Grand Teton. Denali and Gates of Arctic National Parks. and in staff positions at Yellowstone and Voyageurs National Parks. where he persistently fostered Americans deep love for their parks. In his time as superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park. Mr. Martin served as a tireless advocate for the park. its staff. and its many visitors. Through his efforts to initiate and complete extensive upgrades to the crumbling infrastructure at the Grand Canyon. he helped improve the quality of life for the Havasupai tribe and for park employees. as well as enriching the experiences of the 4.5 million people who visit the Grand Canyon each year. Mr. Martin fought to protect the South Rim of the Canyon and the Grand Canyon watershed from the toxic threat of uranium mining. which would have polluted the lifeline of the west. the Colorado River. and put at great risk the wildlife and people that call this area home. He has provided crucial leadership in establishing science as the decisive tool in policy decisions. particularly in his tenacity in demanding Colorado River flow rates that benefit the riparian ecosystem found at the heart of the Grand Canyon. Serving as the Intermountain Regional Director and the Deputy Director for the National Park Service. Mr. Martin was instrumental in preserving critical management policies which will continue to guide the National Park Service as it prepares to celebrate its centennial. Madam Speaker. it is fitting that we honor the 35 years of service that Steve Martin has given to the National Park Service. and that we recognize his passion and advocacy to protect and preserve our National Parks.,4821,4821_park_superintendent_spirtes_ranger,"['park', 'superintendent', 'spirtes', 'ranger', 'canyon', 'dale', 'tollefson', 'parks', 'nps', 'galvin']",park - superintendent - spirtes - ranger - canyon - dale - tollefson - parks - nps - galvin,1,TRUE,1110149765

549147,Mr. President. I wish to speak for a moment about Earth Day. This is the 40th anniversary of Earth Daythe 40th Earth Day. in fact. the 22nd of April. I am speaking now because of my great admiration for the work of Senator Gaylord Nelson in establishing this Earth Day. I was reminded of it in two respects in the last week. One was getting to visit with his widow. Carrie Lee Nelson. who is a great personage herself. who made a great contribution to his career in public service and continues today to advocate for the same issues he advocated for. particularly as they relate to the environment. Also earlier this year. Don Ritchie. our Senate Historian who speaks to us on Tuesdays at the Democratic lunch each week when we get together. gave what I thought was a fitting tribute to Gaylord Nelson that I wanted to share with people. I asked permission to do that. Don Ritchie agreed that was something that was acceptable. I would like to read through this and take 2 or 3 minutes. As the Senate Historian. he recounted the facts as follows: This past weekend. the Mini Page. a syndicated childrens supplement that appears in 500 newspapers across the country. paid special tribute to a former U.S. Senator. Gaylord Nelson. for launching the first Earth Day on April 22. 1970. Five years after his death. Senator Nelson remains an icon of the environmental movement. Senator Nelson used to say he came to environmentalism by osmosis. having grown up in Clear Lake. WI. He promoted conservation as Governor of Wisconsin and. after he was elected to the Senate in 1962. he used his maiden speech to call for a comprehensive nationwide program to save the natural resources of America. He went on to compile an impressive list of legislative accomplishments. which included preserving the Appalachian Trail. banning DDT. and promoting clean air and clean water. But it was Earth Day that gave him international prominence and served as his lasting legacy. Senator Nelson worried that the United States lacked a unity of purpose to respond to the increasing threats against the environment. The problem. in his words. was how to get a nation to wake up and pay attention to the most important challenge the human species faces on the planet. Then a number of incidents converged to help him frame a solution. In 1969. a major oilspill off the coast of Santa Barbara covered miles of beaches with tar. Senator Nelson toured the area in August and was outraged by the damage the oilspill had caused. but was also impressed with the many people who rallied to clean up the mess. Flying back from California. the Senator read a magazine article about the antiVietnam War teachins that were taking place on college campuses. This inspired him to apply the same model to the environment. In September 1969. the Senator charged his staff with figuring out how to sponsor environmental teachins on college campuses nationwide. to be held on the same day the following spring. Rather than organize this effort from the top down. they believed that Earth Day would work better as a grassroots movement. They raised funds to set up an office staffed by college students. with a law student. Denis Hayes. serving as the national coordinate. They identified the week of April 19 to 25 as the ideal time for college schedules and the possibility of good spring weather. Calculating that more students were on campus on Wednesday made Wednesday. April 22. the first Earth Day. Critics of the movement pointed out that April 22 happened to be Vladimir Lenins birthday. but Senator Nelson rebutted that it was also the birthday of the first environmentalist. Saint Francis of Assisi. An astonishing success. the first Earth Day in 1970 was celebrated by some 20 million Americans on 2.000 college campuses. at 10.000 primary and secondary schools. and in hundreds of communities. Forty years later. its commemoration this week is expected to attract 500 million people in 175 countries. I will at some later point talk about the environmental legacy of one of our own Senators from New Mexico. Senator Clinton Anderson. who was one of the prime sponsors and promoters of the Wilderness Act and worked with Gaylord Nelson on many of these same environmental issues and. of course. with President Kennedy. Stewart Udall. and with President Johnson. There are many people who deserve great credit for the legacy in this country and the focus on environmental issues. and Earth Day is an appropriate time to acknowledge their contributions. Mr. President. I yield the floor.,2343,2343_earth_gaylord_nelson_environmental,"['earth', 'gaylord', 'nelson', 'environmental', '1970', 'polluted', 'planet', 'environment', 'warming', 'climate']",earth - gaylord - nelson - environmental - 1970 - polluted - planet - environment - warming - climate,1,TRUE,1110101478
549933,"Mr. President. today I rise to recognize one of our most prominent Wisconsinites. Gaylord Nelson. the founder of Earth Day. On April 22. 1970. 20 million Americans paused for a day to celebrate our planet and press for the urgent actions needed to preserve and protect it. As we observe this 40th anniversary of the first Earth Day. we once again reflect on the necessity of a clean and safe environment. celebrate the successes of the last four decades. and consider the long way we still must go to achieve the goals laid out that day. In Wisconsin. we also stop to remember and honor one of our most prominent citizens. Earth Day was born out of the passion of Gaylord Nelson. His life was one of service from the Pacific theater during World War II. to the State House as a State Senator and Governor. and to Washington. DC where he served Wisconsin as a U.S. Senator for nearly 20 years. When Gaylord came to Washington. he did so with a mission to bring environmental causes to the forefront of the national debate. He believed that the cause of environmentalism needed as much attention as national defense. For his first years in the Senate. his cause was lonely. In 1966. his bill to ban the pesticide DDT garnered no cosponsors. Gaylord knew that only with the grassroots support of regular Americans. could the environmental agenda rise to prominence. His idea for Earth Day came from the student teachins of the 1960s. but his cause inspired people across boundaries of age. race and location. This year. more than one billion people around the world will come together in the same way they did 40 years ago. In a speech on that historic day in 1970. Gaylord noted that his goal was not just one of clean air and water. but also ""an environment of decency. quality and mutual respect for all other human beings and all other living creatures."" He told the crowd that America could meet the challenge through our technology. The unanswered question was. he said. ""Are we willing?"" That question was answered with a resounding yes. That year saw the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the Clean Air Act. In 1972. 6 years after Gaylord Nelson stood alone on his proposed DDT ban. its use was ended. Later years would bring better protection of drinking water. emissions and efficiency standards for cars. programs to cleanup brownfields sites. and the protection and preservation of our forests. rivers. mountains and oceans. Despite that progress and I imagine Gaylord would be the first to note this we still have much work ahead of us. We must use this anniversary to commit to another environmental decade. The needs of 40 years ago cleaner water. cleaner air. more protection of our lands are still here. but the next challenge we must face is climate change. From lower lake levels. to more invasive species. the consequences of unchecked climate change could be devastating to the people of Wisconsin. Climate change isnt just a threat. it is also an opportunity. Structured correctly. the solutions to slowing climate change can also speed up our economic recovery. Remarkable research and development is happening today in Wisconsin on products for cleaner water. advanced battery technology. and using waste from farms and forests to make advanced biofuels. We have companies developing products to harness the power of the sun to replace traditional interior lighting. retrofitting heavyduty trucks into hybrids. and manufacturing energyefficient hot water heaters. In Congress. legislative work to address climate change is ongoing. With the right mixture of requirements and incentives. we can achieve a policy that reduces our dependence on foreign oil. cuts greenhouse gas emissions. lowers prices at the pump and on the electricity bill. and creates goodpaying jobs that cannot be outsourced. We do not have to choose between the environment and the economy. between jobs and solving climate change. Gaylord Nelson made this point over and over again. He once wrote that ""all economic activity depends upon the air. water. soil. forest. minerals. wetlands. rivers. lakes. oceans. wildlife habitats. and scenic beauty."" These. he said. ""are the accumulated capital resources of the nation. Take them away and what you have left is a wasteland."" On this 40th anniversary of Earth Day. while we remember the pioneering sprit of Gaylord Nelson. we must honor his legacy by turning words into action.",2343,2343_earth_gaylord_nelson_environmental,"['earth', 'gaylord', 'nelson', 'environmental', '1970', 'polluted', 'planet', 'environment', 'warming', 'climate']",earth - gaylord - nelson - environmental - 1970 - polluted - planet - environment - warming - climate,1,TRUE,1110101597

553993,"Today. I introduced the Great Lakes Ecosystem Protection Act as cochair of the Great Lakes Task Force with Senator GEORGE VOINOVICH and several of our colleagues here in the Senate and in the House. This bill is important for our efforts to protect and restore the Great Lakes now and for future generations. The Great Lakes are vital not only to Michigan but to the nation. Roughly 110 of the U.S. population lives in the Great Lakes basin and depends daily on the lakes. The Great Lakes provide drinking water to 40 million people in the U.S. and Canada. They provide the largest recreational resource for their 8 neighboring States. They form the largest body of freshwater in the world. containing roughly 18 percent of the worlds total. Only the polar ice caps contain more freshwater. They are critical for our economy by helping move natural resources to the factory and to move products to market. While the environmental protections that were put in place in the early 1970s have helped the Great Lakes make strides toward recovery. a 2003 GAO report made clear that there is much work still to do. That report stated: ""Despite early success in improving conditions in the Great Lakes Basin. significant environmental challenges remain. including increased threats from invasive species and cleanup of areas contaminated with toxic substances that pose human health threats."" More recently. many scientists reported that the Great Lakes are exhibiting signs of stress due to a combination of sources. including toxic contaminants. invasive species. nutrient loading. shoreline and upland land use changes. and hydrologic modifications. A 2005 report from a group of Great Lakes scientific experts states that ""historical sources of stress have combined with new ones to reach a tipping point. the point at which ecosystemlevel changes occur rapidly and unexpectedly. confounding the traditional relationships between sources of stress and the expected ecosystem response."" Asian carp represents a massive threat and a number of important actions are required to deal with it. The zebra mussel. an aquatic invasive species. caused $3 billion in economic damage to the Great Lakes from 1993 to 2003. In 2000. 7 people died after pathogens entered the Walkerton. Ontario drinking water supply from the lakes. In May of 2004. more than 10 billion gallons of raw sewage and storm water were dumped into the Great Lakes. In that same year. more than 1.850 beach closures in the Great Lakes. Each summer. Lake Erie develops a 6.300 square mile dead zone. There is no appreciable natural reproduction of lake trout in the lower four lakes. More than half of the Great Lakes regions original wetlands have been lost. along with 60 percent of the native forests. Wildlife habitat has been destroyed. diminishing opportunities necessary for fishing. hunting and other forms of outdoor recreation. These problems have been well known for several years. and this bill is an effort to address those problems. First. the bill authorizes the Presidents Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. a multiagency effort. which provides the needed federal funds to federal programs as well as nonfederal partners through grants. Building on past success. there are a number of programs that need to be authorized and reauthorized in federal law. For instance. the bill authorizes the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force. established by Executive Order in 2004. so that the many federal agencies operating in the Great Lakes will coordinate with each other. Restoring the Great Lakes involves many stakeholders including the Federal Government. states. cities. tribes and others. and Congress needs to be sure that the Federal agency efforts are in order. The bill also reauthorizes and expands the Great Lakes Legacy program which has been extremely successful and has cleaned up about 900.000 cubic yards of contaminated sediments at Areas of Concern throughout the Great Lakes. This is a partnership program which requires a nonfederal costshare to address the legacy of contaminated sediment in our region. The Legacy program expires at the end of 2010. The bill reauthorizes the EPAs Great Lakes National Program Office which has been and will continue to be a key to moving forward with Great Lakes protection and restoration. This office has been the lead in renegotiating the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. implementing the Great Lakes Legacy program. and implementing its own grant program. Finally. the Great Lakes region needs a process for advising the EPA and other Federal agencies on Great Lakes matters. While there have been various advisory groups that have been pulled together over the years. there has never been a standing advisory entity. and that has been a gap in the governance and management of the Great Lakes. This bill authorizes a new advisory group to provide expertise to the EPA on goals and priorities for Great Lakes restoration and protection. The Great Lakes are a unique American treasure. We are but their temporary stewards. We must be good stewards by doing all we can to ensure that the Federal Government meets its ongoing obligation to protect and restore the Great Lakes.

573648,"Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Natomas Basin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2011. This legislation will authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve the flood control infrastructure in the Sacramento area. safeguarding many thousands of homes and businesses. There is a pressing need to improve levees in Sacramento. a city that is perpetually cited as one of our Nations most atrisk for severe flooding. But even in this highrisk city. there are priority areas. Natomas. which lies between the American and Sacramento rivers. is the top priority for Sacramento flood control. More than 100.000 people in the Natomas flood plain are at high or moderate risk of flooding. The vast majority of these homes would be inundated with over 10 feet of water should a levee break. In some places. inundation levels would exceed 20 feet. The risk is clear. Estimates by the Army Corps of Engineers put the risk of levee failure at 1 in 3. Damages from a single flood could top $7 billion. Recognizing the need to upgrade the levees in Natomas. the Corps of Engineers completed a Chiefs Report in December 2010 that identified $1.1 billion in essential levee improvements. According to the report. the principal levee modifications include the widening of 41.9 miles of existing levees. installation of about 34.8 miles of soil bentonite cutoff wall. installation of 8.3 miles of seepage berms. and bridge remediation on State Route 99. In addition. the report recommends the creation of 75 acres of canal habitat. 200 acres of Marsh habitat. and 60 acres of woodland habitat to ensure the project complies with the Endangered Species Act. The cost of these improvements will be significant. but the burden will be shared. The Chiefs Report recommends that the costs of the improvements be split between the federal government and state and local stakeholders. The report recommends roughly a 65 percent federal share and a 35 percent state and local share. The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency. SAFCA. and the California Department of Water Resources have taken the costshare agreement to heart and are outpacing the Corps of Engineers. They have begun their work on the project even before the federal work has been authorized. SAFCA and California have already invested more than $320 million in the Natomas Basin project and repaired about 18 miles of the basins 42 miles of levees. By the end of 2012. this amount will increase to $370 million. I want to take a moment to recognize SAFCA and the people of Sacramento for their efforts. They have put their money where their mouth is. This project would not be possible without the significant leadership and resources they have already committed. County voters twice approved special tax assessments. in 2007 and 2011. to raise local funds needed to improve the levee system. These assessments will provide more than $80 million of local funds for flood control projects. In addition. local interests have provided an additional $40 million in advance of federal participation for which credit will be sought. that is a total commitment thus far of $120 million The most recent assessment passed overwhelmingly. 84.5 percent of voters supported the measure. Sacramento residents and homeowners understand that this levee improvement project is critical to the safety and viability of their community. Even during the worst economic downturns in a generation. voters stood together. passed the measure and sent a definitive message to Congress. I also want to recognize Representative DORIS MATSUI. author of companion legislation in the House and a champion on this issue. I have had the pleasure of working with my good friend from Sacramento on flood control for nearly a decade. and her commitment and advocacy is unparalleled. I want to reinforce the importance of this legislation. If Sacramento levees fail. the results will be devastating Sacramento International Airport. which serves 4.4 million passengers per year and is the primary aircargo hub for the region. will be largely underwater. Interstate 5. Interstate 80 and State Route 99 will be closed or restricted. These roads serve as freight arteries and facilitate the passage of more than 2.500 trucks per day. Access to the Port of West Sacramento. the citys primary seaport. will be jeopardized. Flooding in Sacramento is not a question of if. but when. Recordbreaking storms hit the region in 1951. 1956. 1964. 1986 and 1997. During the 1997 storm. levee failures in the nearby cities of Olivehurst. Arboga. Wilton. Manteca and Modesto caused mass evacuations and millions of dollars in damages. An even more devastating flood occurred in 1861 when the American River Levee failed. Californias newly elected Governor. Leland Stanford. was forced to take a rowboat to his inauguration and the state capital was temporarily moved to San Francisco. In January of this year. the U.S. Geological Survey released a study entitled ""ARkStorm"" that examined the impacts of an atmospheric river storm event in California. This storm scenario produced rainfall levels seen once every 500 to 1.000 years. In this model. the Central Valley would experience 300 miles of flooding. 20 or more miles wide. Evacuations could involve 1.5 million residents. with hundreds of landslides damaging roads. highways. and homes. There is a statistical possibility that the cataclysmic scenario run by the U.S.G.S. will occur in our lifetime. The possibility is small. but it could happen. So we must be prepared if it does. The Natomas Basin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2011 is one small step toward achieving that. This legislation addresses the needs of one of the highestrisk communities in our Nation. While this legislation isnt cheap. the costshare relieves a sizable share of the Federal responsibility. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",3184,3184_sacramento_flood_levee_levees,"['sacramento', 'flood', 'levee', 'levees', 'flooding', 'natomas', 'dam', 'hmgp', 'engineers', 'folsom']",sacramento - flood - levee - levees - flooding - natomas - dam - hmgp - engineers - folsom,0.920626166,TRUE,1120067688

597109,Mr. President. I rise today to speak about the importance of the Hoover Power Allocation Act of 2011. of which I am a cosponsor. This legislation passed the Congress after a multiyear effort led by Senator HARRY REID. the bills lead author. and I thank him for his work. Upon enactment. Californians will be able to continue buying Hoover Dams power at the cost of production for the next 50 years. The legislation allows the people of southern California whose local governments and utilities signed the 50year contracts that made building Hoover Dam possible to receive 56 percent of the energy produced by the dam for another five decades. For the people of my State. the Hoover Dam has been a consistent supply of affordable. pollutionfree power for decades. The Hoover Dam is one of the largest power plants in the United States. with a capacity of 2.080 megawatts approximately the size of each of Californias nuclear powerplants. Its average production between 1999 and 2008 was about 4.2 billion kilowatthours per year. approximately 2.4 billion kilowatt hours of which goes to southern Californians who buy their power from Southern California Edison. the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. or members of the Southern California Public Power Agency. Hoovers power also plays an essential role moving water into parched and populous southern California. The Metropolitan Water District uses Hoovers power to move its 550.000 acrefeet annual allocation of water from the Colorado River. over five desert mountain ranges. to Los Angeles. Without Hoovers power. the Metropolitan Water Districts cost of moving that water would be inordinately more expensive. And if California rate payers had to buy that much power at market rates instead of Hoover Dams 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour cost of production. it would cost approximately $180 million more each year. And that power would likely come from dirtier. more distant sources. including coal plants. Instead. continued access to Hoovers lowcost. renewable hydropower will keep rates low as Californias utilities bring on new. more expensive renewable power to comply with the States 33percent renewable portfolio standard. The legislation also sets up a process through which new power recipients in California will be determined by the Western Area Power Administration. As explained in the House committee report accompanying this bill. Congress expects the agency to conduct an open hearing and review the process to determine power allocations fairly and equitably. The process should provide the opportunity for irrigation districts. rural electric cooperatives. and other eligible entities to receive allocations. Congress also expects that Western Area Power Administration will evaluate the relevant power requests of potential new Hoover power recipients in an open. thorough. and transparent process to assess both the applicants power needs and the classes of customers they serve. The agency should make allocation determinations in an impartial. unbiased. and objective manner. consistent with State and Federal preference standards. and in a way that provides the most benefit to the most Californians. My colleagues and I also expect that the process and analytical results will be documented and made available for review. Finally. no discussion of Hoover Dam would be complete without acknowledging efforts to protect endangered species. Hoover contractors have committed to providing more than $150 million over 50 years to support the Lower Colorado River MultiSpecies Conservation Program for the protection of 26 endangered. threatened and sensitive species. The legislation authorizing the MSCP was enacted in the 111th Congress and signed into law on March 30. I thank the parties for reaching this agreement. The Hoover Dam is an American success story. And it is a renewable energy success story. During the depths of the Great Depression. Americans stepped forward to help build one of the great engineering marvels of all time. Between 1931 and 1936. our Nation made a massive effort involving thousands of workers more than 100 of whom lost their lives to build a powerplant unlike anything the world had ever seen. Many in Congress at the time argued the cost of Hoover Dam was too high. They argued that government should not be making such large investments in infrastructure. They opposed efforts to invest in an unproven energy technology like hydropower. The debate was strikingly similar to debates we are having in this body today. Luckily for the people of California. believers in American infrastructure and technology won the Hoover Dam debate. The U.S. Congress provided Federal funds. but only after the Department of the Interior arranged power contracts at prices sufficient to both. No. 1. cover the operating and maintenance charges and. No. 2 repay the capital appropriated by the U.S. Congress within 50 years. When the communities and utilities of California. led by the City of Los Angeles. stepped forward to sign those contracts. construction began. As the years have passed. the investment has been repaid and the wisdom of Congresss decision has become apparent. And now we have enacted a law that continues the legacy of Hoover Dam. I thank the generations before us for having the foresight to fund the Hoover Dam. and I hope we can again rekindle the spirit and invest in America.,2805,2805_hydropower_hydroelectric_dam_hoover,"['hydropower', 'hydroelectric', 'dam', 'hoover', 'ferc', 'dams', 'license', '470', 'deadline', 'enloe']",hydropower - hydroelectric - dam - hoover - ferc - dams - license - 470 - deadline - enloe,0.786744728,TRUE,1120076858
598973,Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this amendment submitted with my colleague from New York to reduce the spending at the Botanic Garden. Were in the middle of a spending crisis that may lead to a sovereign debt crisis. In my view. there are very few programs funded by the Federal Government that can be exempt from fiscal responsibility and scrutiny. This is an unprecedented fiscal crisis. I applaud the Appropriations Committees leadership and commitment to making significant spending reductions in this bill. including reducing personal office expenses and committee budgets. There are many wonderful museums and points of interest here in Washington. D.C.. and the Botanic Garden is among the best. My amendment. which would reduce its funding appropriations and take away its proposed increase. is not based on any act or omission by the Botanic Garden. They run a great program here. But let me be clear: as an avid outdoorsman and a gardener myself. I personally derive much benefit from the Botanic Garden right here on Capitol Hill. I have visited these beautiful places many times and always learn and see something new. Our amendment is not intended to make the statement that the Botanic Garden is not a good and worthy program. It is. But it is not constitutionally mandated. It is not essential to providing key services to Americans. It does not generate jobs. It does contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the world. and that has great value. Our country is in the midst of an epic fiscal crisis that threatens the livelihood and wellbeing of every single American. and even good and worthy programs such as the United States Botanic Garden cannot be spared from every effort to scale down our Federal budget significantly. This proposed amendment is a fair cut. indeed. in light of our fiscal crisis. a modest cut and consistent with the committees recommendations for other programs within this bill. I am confident that even with this reduced budget. the Botanic Garden will be able to offer an educational experience to all of us and to our constituents when they come to visit Capitol Hill. It is for those constituents that we offer this amendment and ask you for your support.,4690,4690_botanic_garden_gardens_callaway,"['botanic', 'garden', 'gardens', 'callaway', 'botanical', 'plants', 'beauty', 'gardening', 'buehler', 'brooklyn']",botanic - garden - gardens - callaway - botanical - plants - beauty - gardening - buehler - brooklyn,1,TRUE,1120046931

613999,I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chairman. I also rise in opposition to the amendment which seeks to cut $1.2 million from the Architect of the Capitols Botanic Garden. The hardest hit agency in this building is the Architect of the Capitol. which was cut by $52.5 million. or 11 percent. making it impossible to fund the Capitol dome restoration in this bill. However. the chairman found a small amount of funding to try to keep up with the maintenance of the Botanic Garden. Nevertheless. Members attack because they can get a good headline in the papers for cutting a garden. To that effect. the author of this amendment put out a press release after offering this same amendment last year. In that press release. Representative GOSAR stated: The Botanic Garden has proven its ability to use tax dollars in a costeffective and efficient way. If the Botanic Garden has indeed proven its ability to use its tax dollars in a costeffective manner. why is the gentleman targeting this agency? The public should know that after this amendment. we still wont finish the dome restoration. We still have to rehabilitate the Cannon House Office Building. The gentleman from Arizona wants to make sure the Botanic Garden is added to the scrap heap of buildings that we are unable to keep in working condition. Our constituents sent us here to do real work and look for real solutions to the deficit. not to make political points by attacking institutions like the Botanic Garden. which was established back in 1820. As a Member of Congress. we have a responsibility to ensure that our Nations heritage is kept intact for future generations by both tackling unnecessary spending. but also by making investments in our future. With that. Mr. Chairman. I urge defeat of this amendment.,4690,4690_botanic_garden_gardens_callaway,"['botanic', 'garden', 'gardens', 'callaway', 'botanical', 'plants', 'beauty', 'gardening', 'buehler', 'brooklyn']",botanic - garden - gardens - callaway - botanical - plants - beauty - gardening - buehler - brooklyn,1,TRUE,1120113087

624737,"Madam President. I rise to draw my colleagues attention to an issue of great importance to our rural communities. If Congress does not act. many of our rural counties will face an increasingly dire state of affairs in the months to come. Across the United States. timber counties are facing local budgets suddenly and deeply in the red. This fiscal crisis could mean reduced schooldays. fewer sheriffs. more offenders on the street. and cuts to other basic county services. Congress has the power to avert this impending disaster. and Congress must utilize that power. So we must act without delay to extend the Secure Rural Schools and Communities SelfDetermination Act. Secure Rural Schools is not an entitlement program. it is a commitment this Nation. our Federal Government. made to rural forest counties out of fairness and common sense when it determined it would put environmental overlays over large blocks of forest land that we dedicated to timber production with revenue shared with the local county. This contract between the Federal Government and our rural counties has been at the foundation of our National Forest System. and we in this Chamber need to honor it. Many folks come here and talk about how the Federal Government needs to uphold its share of the bargain. Well. this is an explicit contract with our rural counties. and we need to uphold that bargain. Since 1908more than 100 yearsthe Federal Government has appropriately shared timber revenues with counties for the infrastructure they develop because this timber land is in Federal hands and produces no property tax revenue to support that infrastructure. Let me give some background on what the scale of this issue is for States such as Oregon. Oregon has 2.2 million acres of O&C lands. These lands were granted to the Oregon and California Railroad in 1866 and later reverted to the Federal Government when the railroad failed to live up to its terms of the grant. They also included a class of lands that originated from a similar situationthe Coos Bay Wagon Road lands. These lands make up a large percentage of the acreage in southern and western Oregon. Then there are Forest Service landstimbered lands owned by the Federal Forest Servicethat make up 14 million additional acres across the State of Oregon. When you add it all together. more than half of Oregons lands are federally owned. That means they do not produce a penny of property taxes to support infrastructure in our rural counties. The O&C lands and the Wagon Road lands were dedicated to timber production. with the counties receiving 50 percent of all revenues. Counties with national forest lands received 25 percent of the timber revenues. This created jobs and a source of money to provide counties with that needed infrastructure. In the early 1990s timber production began a long declinea precipitous decline. Trends such as automation and trade hit the sector hard. as they had so many more sectors. On top of this. there were the environmental overlays that dramatically reduced timber harvesting. To compensate for the newly imposed Federal structure that changed the entire pattern of timber production in our rural counties. our National Government developed the Secure Rural Schools Program to provide payments to counties based on historic timber harvest levels but no longer tied directly to the annual timber harvest. This type of arrangement is not unique to Oregon. nor are the problems arising from the lapse of the Secure Rural Schools Program. There are a great many States. particularly in the West. where much of the land is federally owned and counties rely on this program and similar programs to support key infrastructure. It is no wonder that when the Secure Rural Schools payments lapsed in 2006. drastic measures had to be taken to adjust to the loss. Let me give some sense of what this is like in Oregon. In Josephine Countysouthern Oregontwothirds of the countys general fund came from county payments. So loss of county payments means cutting public safety programs. Overnight. in 2006. patrols were cut down to just six individuals to cover an area the size of the State of Rhode Island. In Lake County. where Federal lands make up 61 percent of the county. they cut their Federal road department from 42 individuals to 1414 folks for a road department covering a land area equal to the combined size of Connecticut and Delaware. In Jackson County. where onethird of the general fund comes from Federal payments. the county eliminated 117 jobs in parks. human services. roads. and public safety. and they closed all of their libraries. Let me be clear. When the Federal Government fails to uphold the contract it has struck with our rural timber counties. the suffering is intense. It is an embarrassment that we would permit the Federal Government not to fulfill its commitment under this framework. This impact is so substantial that the Oregon Legislature. when I was serving as speaker. redirected $50 million in transportation funds to the rural counties. In the year of 2007. I organized a bipartisan. bicameral tour of our most affected counties. We went out to talk to the county officials. and when we came back I advocated for and supported this $50 million emergency transfer to compensate for the fact that the Federal Government was breaking its contract with the timber counties in America. Lets not let that happen again. Later. Congress restored this contract. But here we are now. 5 years later. facing the worstcase scenarios all over again. As Yogi Berra said. it is deja vu all over again. Because we failed to pass an extension before we left for the holidays. the last payment occurred a few weeks ago and timber counties dont know what is going to happen now. They would like to think folks in this Chamber will honor and support sustaining this Federal contract with our rural timber counties. but this Chamber has to act to make that happen. The Eugene RegisterGuard recently published an editorial about the situation in Lane County. stating: The emerging picture looks like a multicar pileup on Interstate 5. Lane County is facing a $14 million shortfall. More than half of this-$7.2 millionwill have to be absorbed by the sheriffs office. What does that mean for Lane County? It means the end of 24hour patrol. with coverage limited to just 16 hours a day. It means so few officers that they would be unable to respond except ""to the most serious of crimes."" It means parole and probation supervision will be eliminated for hundreds of offenders and 130 jail beds would have to be closed. In addition. the district attorneys office faces a $1.9 million reduction in county funding. which would mean the loss of between 12 to 20 employees in the criminal division and potential shutdown of the countys medical examiners office. And this is one of the counties that is in better shape. Others could go bankrupt as early as June of this year. As the RegisterGuard newspaper says. it is ""a dire predicament. and in desperate need of help from Congress."" Rural counties in Oregon and elsewhere deserve to have the Federal Government honor its contract and to have the peace of mind that funds guaranteed to pay for their infrastructure are therefor the roads. for schools. for public safety. In this contract between the Federal Government and rural America. the Federal Government must uphold its end of the bargain. Rural counties have been on a roller coaster for far too long. They have been flying off the tracks. Pick any metaphor you wanta pileup on I5. a roller coaster or a train running off the tracksthis is the situation in our rural timber counties. And those Members who dont have rural counties have other situations where there are vital Federal commitments. This one must be honored by this Chamber. The first step is to extend the Secure Rural Schools Program as soon as possible. President Obama has supported and proposed and included in his budget a 5year reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools and has made it mandatory spending. This shortterm funding is a critical bridge to maintain schools and law enforcement in timber counties while we work for a viable longterm. sustainable management solution for Federal forests. I want to be clear. Timber counties would rather have forest practices that allow sustained production of timber. as these lands were dedicated to. That creates jobs. it supports the whole supply chain. and it provides logs to the independent mills that dont own their own forest land. That is the vitality of rural communities. My father worked at a sawmill when I was bornHarbor Plywood in Riddle. OR. and I lived in the adjoining town of Myrtle Creek. Those of us with a timber background understand the essential nature of this Federal contract. We must get it done in this Chamber. I urge my colleagues to support it.",1311,1311_counties_timber_rural_payments,"['counties', 'timber', 'rural', 'payments', 'forest', 'selfdetermination', 'pilt', '3058', 'county', 'receipts']",counties - timber - rural - payments - forest - selfdetermination - pilt - 3058 - county - receipts,0.722559763,TRUE,1120087287

645552,"Mr. Speaker. last week. just after suppertime in a neighborhood in McLean. Virginia. a 14yearold girlwell call her Sarahwas jumping on a neighbors backyard trampoline. Suddenly. Sarah heard a noise and looked up. only to see a lowflying object hovering overhead. It was a small. remotecontrolled flying object. It was a drone. It had a blinking red light coming from it. The object hovered over her for about 10 minutes. She began to get real nervous and uneasy. So she jumped off the trampoline and ran home to tell her parents. but the flying object continued to follow her. She told her mother. So her mother walked outside into the street and observed the flying object. Suddenly. the object moved away into another neighbors backyard. where three other teenage girls were sitting in the pool. The small drone hovered over them momentarily. then it moved away. The police were called. They arrived at the scene and told the citizens: ""Sorry. theres nothing we can do."" Mr. Speaker. this sounds like something out of a scifi moviesomeone up to no good spying on teenage girls with a drone. Mr. Speaker. drones are easy to find and easy to obtain. With a simple Google search. you will find out that one can buy a drone on eBay or go down the street and buy one at Radio Shack. According to the FAA. the group that monitors and issues permits for drones. by 2030. there will be 30.000 drones cruising American skieslooking. observing. filming. spying. and hovering over America. We will not know who they are. what theyre up to. what theyre looking at. or what their purpose is. whether its permitted or really not permitted. whether its lawful or unlawful. And we wont know whos flying those drones. There are legitimate uses for government and private citizens for the use of drones. but a nosey neighbor or snooping government should not be able to spy on citizens without legal guidelines. As technology changes. Congress has the responsibility to be proactive and protect the Fourth Amendment right of all citizens-""The right of people to be secure in their persons. houses. papers. and effects. against unreasonable searches and seizures. shall not be violated."" Thus sayeth the Constitution. Nowadays especially. Americans are concerned about their Fourth Amendment rights being taken away. Well. no kidding. The right of a reasonable expectation of privacy is a constitutional right. The general rule is snooping. spying. surveillance. or eavesdropping goes against the basic rights outlined in the Constitution. That is why I have introduced the Preserving American Privacy Act. along with Representative ZOE LOFGREN from California. Congress must be proactive in protecting the rights of civilians from private use and government use of drones. This legislation balances individual constitutional rights with legitimate government activity and the private use of drones. The bill sets forth clear guidelines. protects individual privacy. and informs peace officers so they will know what they can and cannot do under the law. There will be limits on government use of drones so that the surveillance of individuals or their property is only permitted or conducted when there is a warrant based on probable cause. as the Constitution requires. Of course there will be exceptions. They are called exigent circumstances. which is already in our law. and these will apply. as it does now. regarding search and seizure. Those exceptions include fire and rescue. monitoring droughts and floods. assisting in other emergency cases. or to chase a fleeing criminal. The bill also allows for the use of drones for border security. The bill also sets forth guidelines for the private use of drones. Basically. private citizens cannot use drones to spy on others without consent of the landowner or that person. Congress has the obligation to set forth guidelines. to secure the right of privacy. and protect citizens from unlawful drone surveillance while maintaining lawful private and government use. Drone laws are needed because a Peeping Tom should not be able to spy on young girls who are in the privacy of their backyards just because the Peeping Tom has the ability to do so. And thats just the way it is.",4476,4476_drones_drone_peeping_object,"['drones', 'drone', 'peeping', 'object', 'trampoline', 'hovered', 'spying', 'snooping', 'spy', 'scifi']",drones - drone - peeping - object - trampoline - hovered - spying - snooping - spy - scifi,0.393264756,TRUE,1130027920

662557,"Mr. President. I rise today to reintroduce the Natomas Basin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2013. This legislation authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve the flood control infrastructure in the Sacramento area. The improvements will safeguard hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses. There is a pressing need to improve levees in Sacramento. The Army Corps perpetually cites the city as one of our nations most atrisk for severe flooding. A quick review of the Corps National Levee Database will tell you why. Of the nearly 300 miles of levees within 10 miles of Sacramento the Corps has deemed 94 miles of levees. or 32 percent. ""unacceptable."" An unacceptable designation means the levee is deficient to the point where it does not provide the protection it is supposed to. The Corps has deemed 29 miles of levees. only 10 percent. ""minimally acceptable."" The Corps has yet to even review the remaining 172 miles. 58 percent. None of the 300 miles of levees within 10 miles of Sacramento received the passing grade of ""acceptable."" But even in this highrisk city. there are priority areas. And the Natomas basin. which lies between the American and Sacramento rivers. is the top priority for Sacramento flood control. More than 100.000 people in the Natomas flood plain are at high or moderate risk of flooding. The vast majority of these homes would be inundated with more than 10 feet of water should a levee break. In some places. inundation levels would exceed 20 feet. The risks are clear. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates the damage from a single flood could top $7 billion. Recognizing the need to upgrade the Natomas levees. the Corps of Engineers completed a Chiefs Report in December 2010 that identified $1.1 billion in essential levee improvements. According to the report. the principal levee modifications include the widening of 41.9 miles of existing levees. installation of about 34.8 miles of soil bentonite cutoff wall. installation of 8.3 miles of seepage berms. and bridge remediation on State Route 99. In addition. the report recommends the creation of 75 acres of canal habitat. 200 acres of marsh habitat. and 60 acres of woodland habitat to ensure the project complies with the Endangered Species Act. The cost of these improvements will be significant. but the burden will be shared. Understanding the urgency of this work. the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency. SAFCA. and the California Department of Water Resources have begun work on the levee. They have invested more than $400 million in the Natomas Basin project. far more than their share. and completed about 18 miles of the basins 42 miles of levees. I want to recognize SAFCA and the people of Sacramento for this good work. They have done the right thing. moving ahead before the federal authorization. because peoples lives and property are in danger. I am proud to say the people of Sacramento have really stepped up and contributed. On two occasions county voters approved special tax assessments to begin paying for the repairs on the levee system. first in 2007 and again in 2011. The most recent assessment passed overwhelmingly with 84.5 percent of voters supporting the measure. This kind of local commitment should be a model for the Nation. When such major vulnerabilities exist that threaten a community. it is imperative to act quickly. If the Sacramento levees fail. the results will be devastating Sacramento International Airport. which serves 4.4 million passengers per year and is the primary aircargo hub for the region. will be largely underwater. Interstate 5. Interstate 80 and State Route 99 will be closed or restricted. These roads serve as freight arteries and facilitate the passage of more than 2.500 trucks per day. Access to the Port of West Sacramento. the citys primary seaport. will be jeopardized. Just months ago Superstorm Sandy slammed into the East Coast. The destruction in New York and New Jersey reminded us that unpredictable weather events can overwhelm our infrastructure with devastating consequences. But with wellplaced timely investments. much of worst damage can be averted. Thats why even during the worst economic downturns in a generation. Sacramento voters stood together and passed the local taxmeasure to fund this critical project. We dont know when the next flood will occur. but we do know Sacramento has a welldocumented history of catastrophic flooding. Recordbreaking storms hit the region in 1956. 1964. 1986 and 1997. During the 1997 storm. levee failures in the nearby cities of Olivehurst. Arboga. Wilton. Manteca and Modesto caused mass evacuations and millions of dollars in damage. Going back even further. an even more devastating flood in 1861 occurred when the American River Levee failed. Californias newly elected Governor. Leland Stanford. was forced to take a rowboat to his inauguration at the State Capitol. The flooding was so bad the state government was temporarily relocated to San Francisco. U.S. Geological Survey scientists now believe that the 1861 storm may have been an atmospheric river storm. or ""ARkStorm."" These events. which occur every 200 to 400 years. can produce truly devastating floods. In 2011. the USGS conducted a study about the impacts of a large ARkStorm in Californias Central Valley. The results were shocking. The storm would cause a 300 mile long. 20 mile wide flood zone across much of our nations most productive agriculture lands. It would force the evacuation of 1.5 million residents and cause hundreds of landslides damaging roads. highways. and homes. The study estimates the cost to private homeowners and businesses would be $725 billion. nearly three times the cost of a major earthquake in the State. The bottom line is this: the infrastructure currently in place will not stand up to a storm of this magnitude. And the Natomas Basin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2011 is one small step toward preparing for such a disaster. This legislation is nearly identical to the bill I introduced with my friend and colleague Senator BOXER. the Chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. last Congress. The only change is that the current bill does not include language from the previous bill that specifically allowed ""credits"" for nonfederal work on the project. This modification should not be interpreted to reflect a change my support for the work of the local entities. I believe they have done the right thing by beginning construction on this project. and I support them receiving credit for their work. Instead. the modification was included to comport with work being done by Chairwoman BOXER on the upcoming Water Resources Development Act. or WRDA. That bill will generically address nonFederal crediting provisions and I will work with Chairman BOXER to ensure that Sacramento can still receive credits for the work they have completed. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.",3184,3184_sacramento_flood_levee_levees,"['sacramento', 'flood', 'levee', 'levees', 'flooding', 'natomas', 'dam', 'hmgp', 'engineers', 'folsom']",sacramento - flood - levee - levees - flooding - natomas - dam - hmgp - engineers - folsom,0.754239185,TRUE,1130002797

665952,Mr. President. today I am reintroducing bipartisan legislation to provide support for environmental education in our Nations classrooms. I thank Senators KIRK. MURRAY. TOM UDALL. DURBIN. and WHITEHOUSE for agreeing to be original cosponsors of the No Child Left Inside Act of 2013. According to the National Association for Environmental Education. 47 states and the District of Columbia have taken steps towards developing plans to integrate environmental literacy into their statewide educational initiatives. In Rhode Island. organizations such as the Rhode Island Environmental Education Association. Roger Williams Park Zoo. Save the Bay. the Nature Conservancy. and the Audubon Society. as well as countless schools and teachers. are offering educational and outdoor experiences that many children may never otherwise have. helping inspire them to learn. In partnership with the Rhode Island Department of Education. these organizations have developed a statewide environmental literacy plan that is now being put into action. Given the major environmental challenges we face today. our bill seeks to prioritize teaching our young people about their natural world. For more than three decades. environmental education has been a growing part of effective instruction in Americas schools. Responding to the need to improve student achievement and prepare students for the 21st century economy. many schools throughout the Nation now offer some form of environmental education. Yet. environmental education is facing a significant challenge. and remains out of reach for too many children. With many schools being forced to scale back or eliminate environmental programs. fewer and fewer students are able to take part in related classroom instruction and field investigations. however effective or in demand these programs are. The No Child Left Inside Act would increase environmental literacy among elementary and secondary students by encouraging and providing assistance to states for the development and implementation of environmental literacy plans and promoting professional development for teachers on how to integrate environmental literacy and field experiences into their instruction. The legislation would also support partnerships with highneed school districts to initiate. expand. or improve their environmental education curriculum. and for replication and dissemination of effective practices. Finally. the legislation would support interagency coordination and reporting on environmental education opportunities across the Federal Government. This legislation has broad support among national and State environmental and educational groups. The American public recognizes that the environment is a central issue to our future health and wellbeing. In the private sector. business leaders also increasingly believe that an environmentally literate workforce is critical to their longterm success. They recognize that better. more efficient environmental practices improve the bottom line and help position their companies for the future. Environmental education helps prepare the next generation with the skills and knowledge necessary to be competitive in the global economy. Studies have shown that it enhances student achievement in science and other core subjects and increases student engagement and critical thinking skills. And it promotes healthy lifestyles by encouraging kids to get outside. That is why I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the bipartisan No Child Left Inside Act and to join with Senator KIRK and me to include its provisions into the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.,2761,2761_environmental_sustainability_steinbrenner_farmingdale,"['environmental', 'sustainability', 'steinbrenner', 'farmingdale', 'green', 'ecklund', 'apecs', '3036', 'ohlone', 'sustainable']",environmental - sustainability - steinbrenner - farmingdale - green - ecklund - apecs - 3036 - ohlone - sustainable,1,TRUE,1130038051

689887,I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chair. I rise in opposition to the gentlemans amendment which seeks to cut over $3 million from the Architect of the Capitols Botanic Gardenthe peoples Botanic Garden. Now. I understand the gentleman from Arizona is trying to generate headlines by attempting to cut muchneeded funding to one of the most beloved destinations in Washington. D.C.. our Nations Capital. but this is not the way to fix our Nations deficit. Over 200 years ago. George Washington had a vision for our Capital City to include a botanic garden that would demonstrate and promote the important role plant life plays in our Nation. It may seem trivial. but the Botanic Garden. established in 1820. is one of the oldest botanic gardens in the United States. It is also one of the most visited destinations on the Capitol complex. In fact. I know it is my own childrens favorite place to visit when they come to Washington. D.C.. and often our first stop. Our constituents sent us here to do real work and look for real solutions to the deficit. not to try to score cheap political points by attacking important institutions that have already taken a fiscal hit. like the Botanic Garden. The gentleman says that no lineitem or opportunity can be looked over when it comes to reducing our deficit. Yet. I urge the gentleman if he is looking for ways to significantly reduce our deficit. to urge the House Republican leadership to address comprehensive immigration reform. which would result in a $900 million reduction in the deficit over the next 20 years. Going after a garden isnt the answer. In fact. I think it is important to note that since President Obama took office. our deficit has been cut by more than 50 percent as a percentage of our GDP. With that. I urge the Members to defeat this illadvised amendment.

722690,"Mr. President. rise today to introduce legislation that I have cosponsored for a number of years. that will remedy the problems that have been created by this administrations decision to apply the. Inventoried. Roadless Area Conservation Rule to Alaska. especially in Southeast Alaskas Tongass National Forest. and also in the Chugach National Forest of Southcentral Alaska. I am joined today in introducing that bill by my Alaska colleague Senator DAN SULLIVAN. Back in 2001 the Clinton administration promulgated the Nationwide Inventoried Area Roadless Conservation Rule. Initially the rule did not cover the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. which has been the subject of congressional review and special legislation twice in the past 35 years. first in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act in 1980. which reduced the allowable timber harvest in the 16.9million acre forest from nearly 1 billion board feet a year to a 450 million board foot harvest level. and later by the Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990. which further reduced the allowable harvest level to 267 million board feet annually. Congress in 1980 created 5.75 million acres of wilderness by creating 14 wilderness areas in the forest. and in 1990 further reduced the lands available for timber harvesting by creating five additional wilderness areas totaling 296.000 acres and 12 Land Unit Designation 11 areas of 727.700 acres that increased the protected acreages in the Tongass to more than 6.4 million. With the passage of the Sealaska lands bill in 2014. total protected acreage in the Tongass has risen to 6.55 million acres. Lands classified for potential timber production have been drastically reduced since the 1980 Acts passage. In the Tongass Land Management Plans. TLPM. crafted after ANILCAs passage. 13.3 million acres of the forest. nearly 80 percent. have been restricted from resource development. Of the 9.5 million acres of commercial timber lands in the Tongass only 3.4 million were open for development after 1980 and only 800.000. including previously logged areas. were permittedplanned for harvest over a prospective 100year timber rotation. harvesting limited to about 8.250 acres a yearA percent of the total land area. That included about 400.000 ""new"" acres of new timber lands over a century on top of the roughly 425.000 acres harvested since modern timber activities in Southeast Alaska began in the 1950s and allowed in part for reentry in the future. Since passage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act. and since imposition of the Inventoried Roadless Rule. potential harvesting has dropped even further. The 2001 Inventoried Roadless Areas in the Tongass include 9.5 million acres. 57 percent of the entire forest. while 5.4 million acres. 99 percent. of the Chugach National Forest in Southcentral Alaska were placed in protected status. In the Tongass 7.4 million acres are in the highest protected status of inventoried roadless meaning that not only cant roads be built for forestry. but that access is not allowed for other uses such as renewable energy development. Overall. between the Inventoried Roadless Rule and other land protections. fewer than 176.000 acres of ""new"" timber lands are planned for harvest over the next 100 years. cutting the allowable sale quantity below 267 mmbf. The drop in employment in the region has been chilling. According to the Forest Service. total direct timber sector employment fell from a high of 3.543 average annual employees in 1990 to 402 in 2007. Tongass employment in logging and sawmilling has declined from 409 in 2001. the first year of the roadless rule. to 114 by 2007. The drop off in timber activity would actually be higher except the State of Alaska. to the degree that it could. increased State timber sales. In 2002. for example. 73 percent of all timber cut in Southeast came from Federal forest lands. while by 2007 the percentage stood at barely half coming from Federal lands. Without changes in the roadless rule to allow some additional timber harvest areas and other energy and mineral development. no more than about 3 percent of the Nations largest forest will ever be developed and Southeast Alaska will be forced to depend solely on fisheries and tourism as economic engines. potentially returning the region to its impoverished economy of the 1940s. Today I am introducing legislation to simply exempt Alaska from the Inventoried Roadless Rule. That will not permit economic development on all 9.5 million acres of IRA lands in the Tongass or many of the lands in the Chugach. They will continue to be protected by the terms of the national forest plans for both forests. What it will do is permit land planners the flexibility to propose more rational land planning decisions in the future. It would allow the Forest Service the ability to permit road and electric transmission lines to be placed to tap the regions huge hydroelectric potentialthere being 300 megawatts of hydropower available from known sites. if distribution lines can be built at reasonable cost to get the power to markets. Adding some timber back to the timber base would allow a timber industry to again help the regions economy. But that would not harm the environment and wildlife. Already of the 537.451 acres of productive oldgrowth. POG. trees left in the Tongass. 437.000 are in permanent conservation areas81 percent. The roadless rule may make sense in the contiguous states since there are at least some roads and utility lines that cross those States national forests. In Southeast Alaska. however. there is no transportation network except a marine ferry system. and no permitted electrical transmission system. It simply made no sense in 2001 for the Inventoried Roadless Rules to apply to Alaska. The rule is not needed since by existing plans and regulations. even without IRAs. 96 percent of the Tongass will remain protected. An exemption from the rule will simply allow Alaskans an opportunity to make thoughtful decisions on development in a region 18 times larger than the state of Delaware. but with 1.300 miles of road in the entire region. 110 of the road miles of tiny Delaware.

740686,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to draw attention to wildfires and forest management. Recent headlines show that our forests are in terrible shape: 8.8 million acres have burned this year. $250 million was recently transferred from forest management accounts to fight fires. announced last week. Emergency fire spending has already topped $700 million this year and is still growing. We have a problem that is greatly decreasing and impairing the value of our forest for the next generation. I worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass H.R. 2647. the Resilient Federal Forests Act. back in July. This bill was supported from Maine to Alaska by Democrats and Republicans. The bill ends the destructive practice of fire borrowing in a fiscally responsible manner. It creates a subaccount under the Stafford Act for wildfire. This ensures that resources to put out major fires are available when necessary. This week. the Obama administration publicly called on the Congress to fix fire borrowing. While I appreciate the Presidents interest. I agree with him that we need to fix fire borrowing. I applaud the 19 Democrats who voted for H.R. 2647 that fixes fire borrowing. Fixing fire borrowing alone wont solve the problem. Fixing fire borrowing alone simply is treating a symptom instead of a disease. It is like putting on a bandaid without cleaning out the wound. Again. the House passed this bipartisan legislation back in July. We could be fixing these problems now. but the Senate hasnt acted. It is time for the Senate to act. It is time to stop playing politics with our Nations forests. one of our most treasured resources. The House offered a solution. Lets embrace constructive governance and make H.R. 2647 the law of the land. I want to take a moment and look at what the Resilient Federal Forests Act does. We already talked about fire borrowing. but it also prevents future fires. H.R. 2647 gives the Forest Service the tools it needs to better manage our national forests immediately after its passage. Our forests are overgrown. and therefore. they are fire prone. Fighting fires doesnt prevent future fires. That is why we need better management. Scientific thinning helps prevents future fires. I would like to show some photographs from a forest in my home State of Arkansas. To some. this may look like a healthy. thriving forest because you see trees and you see a lot of greenery. but I am a forester. and when I look at that. I see an overstock stand of trees. I see too much undergrowth. I see too much dead and dying material on the forest floor. This is not a healthy forest. but this happens to be a control site in the middle of a healthy forest. Next. I want to show how we get to a healthy forest on this particular side. This area has been thinned. and there is controlled burns taking place. These burns take place on intervals of 3 to 5 years. They not only make the forest better to withstand potential forest fires. they also create better wildlife habitat. The biodiversity in this forest goes through the roof when these kind of management practices are put in place. We get healthy trees. We get an early successional habitat that is good for wildlife. It also is good for the soil. it is good for water quality. and it is good for air quality. This last picture shows what a healthy forest in my district looks like. These trees are thriving. This is an early growth not too long after a fire. This is a great wildlife habitat. The biodiversity of wildlife and plant life is much higher in this photograph than what we saw in the previous photograph. This creates a winwin situation. Now. this isnt the solution for everywhere across the country. this is what works in the forests in my district. but there are forest managers across this country that know how to manage their forests in their particular climate and in their particular setting to create healthy forests and forests that can withstand a fire. It would be almost impossible for a forest fire to destroy these trees. The next thing that the Resilient Federal Forests Act does is it stops frivolous lawsuits. You may ask: Why do we need to stop frivolous lawsuits? Well. frivolous lawsuits hinder forest plans that are developed locally. using science. best management practices. and collaborative efforts that represent stakeholder values. The end result is a forest that is decreased and impaired in value for our next generation. This bill discourages frivolous lawsuits by requiring those suing to stop collaborative projects to post a bond. If the plaintiff loses. they pay the taxpayers legal bills. If they win. they get their money back. This bill also aids in better land management planning. In the words of former U.S. Forest Service chief Dale Bosworth: ""We do not have a fire problem on our Nations forests. we have a land management problem. And it needs to be addressed quickly."" Delayed decisionmaking or. even worse. no decisionmaking at all. is hurting our forests. Forests are dynamic. They are a living. growing organism. When we say no action. we are actually taking action. Since forests are not static. scientific analysis should not be static. This bill requires the Forest Service to critically analyze the impacts of no action. which often are overgrowth. increased wildfire. and diseases. Increases in future wildfire problems are often caused because of poor land management. It makes it difficult for reforestation. ultimately decreasing and impairing the value of forests. This bill sets up requirements for salvage plans in response to catastrophic events. It requires environmental assessments for salvage projects to be completed within 90 days so that timber can be removed while it is still commercially valuable.",115,115_forest_forests_timber_fires,"['forest', 'forests', 'timber', 'fires', 'trees', 'wildfire', 'fire', 'wildfires', 'thinning', 'logging']",forest - forests - timber - fires - trees - wildfire - fire - wildfires - thinning - logging,1,TRUE,1140050721

741996,I thank the gentleman. I thank you for your leadership and bringing your expertise to Washington. It is great to serve with you. and I appreciate all the leadership that you are showing. not just on this issue but so many different issues that are good not just for the folks of Arkansas. but for the entire Nation. So thank you so much for being part of this Special Order tonight. Mr. Speaker. a healthy forest is so incredibly important because a healthy forest represents. also. wealthy communities. Our rural communities are so dependent on the active. proper management of our national forests. These national forests didnt always exist. At one time. our predecessorssome going back 100 years or morecame to the table with the local communities. and they made a commitment that for the good of the Nation they would create national forests. Now. lets be clear. National forests are not national parks. They are completely different. National forests are not managed by the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. National forests are managed by the Department of Agriculture. because they were set aside and established so that our Nation would always have an abundant. ready supply of timber. Timber was one of the initial industries that we had. It was so important to the past of our country. but important to the future of our country as well. As Mr. WESTERMAN really articulated well. when you have a healthy forest. you have carbon sinks and you have filters. A lot of our watersheds originate in our national forests. so it is good for clean water if they are properly managed. It is good for clean air. and it is good for the economy. Mr. Speaker. from time to time. I spend some time as a lay pastor and I will fill the pulpit. When I am talking to the churches. I talk about how a healthy church is like a healthy forest. If I go into a church and I see that everyone sitting in the pews has my hairline. a little bit of salt on the side here with gray hair. that is not a healthy church. It is just kind of one generation. Well. forests are the same way. If you want a healthy church. you need multiple generations in the pews. If you want a healthy forest. you need multiple generations of forest because it is good for the wildlife. it is good for the birds. and it is good for the mammals. because they need different types of forests at different points in their maturity in order to support that wildlife. Mr. Speaker. one of the things that leads to putting pressure on certain species is. when we stop harvesting trees. we stop active management. because we know that almost every species. at different times in their life. need that kind of open area. They need time in young forest growth right through to more mature forest growth. Without that. these species cant be supported. So there are all kinds of reasons. let alone the economic health of our rural communities. That was a promise that was made by our predecessors when they took this land out of the private sector and put it into the public sector. It was done with a promise that they would always do active management in such a way to generate the revenue to be able to backfill for those property taxes that would have been lost. We have really failed at that as a nation. Our rural communities in and around our national forests are so challenged. Dont get me wrong. I think we have great people that are working for the Forest Service. I spend a lot of time with them. They are dedicated professionals. I think the Chief of the Forest Service. Tom Tidwell. is an outstanding individual. has strong character. I like the Chief because his first job in the Forest Service was when he was going to college and he worked summers as a firefighter. I am an old firefighter. He has done all the jobs. He knows what it is to manage an active forest. We have a lot of pressures. though. that the bureaucracy has placed on him. We have a lot of external pressures with special interest groups who claim they are trying to save the forests. But the end result of their actions where they limit. they sue. and they prevent forest plans from being implemented and prevent timber management from occurring. they are actually killing the forests. Forests are living entities. If they are not actively managed. they will get sick and they will die. When they do. they become emitters of carbon. When a forest is healthy. it actually absorbs carbon. It is a carbon sink. as I said before. Mr. Speaker. let me talk about some of the statistics that show that much of our national forest system is unhealthy. In fact. the Forest Service has identified up to onequarter of nearly 200 million acres of national forest land as a wildfire risk. We have seen a dramatic reduction. Mr. Speaker. of the harvest from our national forests from nearly 13 billion board feet in the 1980s to roughly 3 million board feet in past years. Let me put that into perspective and share some statistics on that. Lets go back to 1995. In 1995. Mr. Speaker. onesixth of the Forest Service budget was used for wildfire management and mitigation. It was reasonable. At that point. when we were using onesixth of the Forest Service budget. we were harvesting in 1995 3.8 billion board feet. Lets fastforward to 2015. Now. the numbers I am going to share with you are from August of 2015. I readily admit I dont have the past couple months in this. but at this point. the Forest Service is spending 50 percent of its budget on fighting wildfires50 percent. Think about 50 percent of your household. 50 percent of your familys budget. your business. or a local school. To take 50 percent of your budget just for this type of crisis management doesnt work. It just doesnt work. At the same time. Mr. Speaker. we have only projected to harvest. at that point. 2.4 billion board feet. It is a big part of the lack of active management. We need to provide the Forest Service tools to be able to help them do their jobs. The highwater mark was back in 1987 when we had 12.7 billion board feet harvested. That is a variance from this year of 10.3 billion board feet. We are constantly talking about the economic crisis that we are in here. and we are. We have got a debt that has been out of control. I am very proud to be a part of a Republicanled Congress that. for a number of years. on the discretionary side. we have actually reduced our spending. and we are starting to get our arms wrapped around mandatory spending. So we are doing our job. But there is a need for more resources. and we recognize that. There is a need for more revenue. We are literally burning that revenue up in our national forests each and every year. dramatically. How much revenue? I would have to say that. if you take. every year. 10.3 billion board feet. if that is the amount that we could get our annual harvesting to. you have to ask yourself: How much more healthy would the forest be? If the forest is healthy. Mr. Speaker. so many fewer wildfires would occur at just an incredible cost. including the loss of lives. We have lost a tremendous number of American heroes. our firefighters from both the U.S. Forest Service but also volunteer firefighters like myself. Perhaps some professional firefighters have lost their lives because of the incident. It is just the crisis that we have in wildfires. If we would increase our harvesting. we would increase the health of the forest. and we could reduce wildfires and that risk. We would also increase revenue. I am not prepared to tell you what the average value of a board foot in timber harvest off our national forests is. I know that varies greatly. Mr. Speaker. I happen to represent the Allegheny National Forest. I am proud to say that it is actually the most profitable national forest in the country. It is kind of puny compared to my colleagues out west. We are about 513.000 acres. but we have got the worlds best hardwood cherry. Our hardwoods are what increase the value. I know that is a wide variance on what the value of 1 board foot in 2015 of timber harvested in our national forests is. But whatever that number is. multiply it by $10.3 billion. and that is a lot of revenue that is owned by the taxpayers of this countrygiven the fact it is their national forestthat we could be bringing in. Then the prosperity. Mr. Speaker. If we could unleash and get timber in closer to that sustainable rate. what that would do for our school districts. our kids. our families. and the jobs that would be stimulated in the forest products industry. It would just have an amazing impact. Mr. Speaker. Now. as we examine these issues. Mr. Speaker. it becomes easier to see how everything is corrected. Trees which should have been harvested years ago have been allowed to become fuel for forest fires. leading to the rise in the acreage burned that we have seen in recent years. There are many prospective solutions to this problem. including the Agricultural Act of 2014. also known as the farm bill. I am very proud that all the Members were involved with the farm bill. It was a great bipartisan bill that we did. It includes provisions to include improved forest management. So we have taken action. We have enacted into law some tools for the Forest Service. There is just more that we need to do. Mr. Speaker. Those tools include an expedited process in the planning for projects and the reauthorization programs. such as the stewardship contracting and the Good Neighbor Authority. These all improve forest health. timber sales. and restoration. Now. the House passed the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015. which Mr. WESTERMAN very appropriately talked about. in July. The goal of this legislation was to provide the Forest Service with direction and the tools to address the challenges of litigation. I have to tell you. Mr. Speaker. we have forest plans that are about active timber management. but we have these outside groups that sue the government because the government reimburses their costs. even when they settle out of court. That is not why the Equal Access to Justice Act was originally written. not for some group that is not a direct stakeholder in terms of having property that is in the forest or adjoined to the forest. But it is litigation. it is funding. no doubt about it. it is the process. it is basic timber harvesting. and essential active management. I will come back to some of those in just a bit. I want to share some outcomes from the most recent hearing that we had with the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee. I am proud to cosponsor this important piece of legislation. I believe that it should become law. It will have a major impact on reducing catastrophic wildfires across the Nation. The district that I represent. Pennsylvanias Fifth Congressional District. is the home of the Allegheny National Forest. the only national forest in the Commonwealth. It encompasses more than 513.000 acres across four counties. and for generations. it has formed the economic bedrock of small communities in that region. In some ways. the Allegheny is very different from our western forestsI have mentioned some of thosebut it has many similar challenges. including a lack of timbering. reduced county budgets. and outbreaks of invasive species. Reforming the way we deal with wildfires and forestry management will have a positive effect in forests and in rural communities. not just in the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania. but. quite frankly. across the Nation. I look forward to hearing more from my colleagues. and taking opportunities in the future to host more of these Special Orders. in looking at ways so that we can confront the very real challenges in national forest regions. I wanted to share some of the outcomes from our most recent hearing that we had on this issue back on October 8. We had some great speakers come in. witnesses. that provided testimony from all over the country. I will just share with you. Mr. Speaker. some of the things that would be helpful. things that we need to consider. I am going to start in the category of increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of forest management that we have. starting with giving an opportunity for State primacy. This was an idea that came out from a rancher in Washington State. The States tend to have less bureaucracy. they have less of a target on their back by these outside groups that are suing. So the States success at increasing active timber management and a higher level of forest health. But State primacy is something that was an idea that came out that needs to. at least. have further consideration. Expanding what we call categorical exemption from NEPA analysis. That doesnt mean that we are not looking at the environmental impacts. That couldnt be further from the truth. For where it makes sense. what we need to do is provide a categorical exemption from a fullblown NEPA analysis. but we need to do that more on a landscape perspective. so a landscape management. We are talking large scale. 100.000 acres or more. being able to more efficiently. being able to more effectively. manage the forest. We have provided some categorical exemption opportunities within the farm bill to the Forest Service for regular maintenance activities. where they had to spend a tremendous amount of resources just to clear a power line or to do trail maintenance. or replant after a forest fire. wildfire. Quite frankly. their sister agencies: the Bureau of Land Management and the Corps of Engineers. they didnt have to do that. So this is just kind of common sense. We need to protect our active management funds. We cant be dipping into the funds that we use to manage the forest. That is what happened. That is what I referred to as that large sucking sound. It is not just resources. My forest supervisor. who does a great job. she was detailed. She went out west for a period of time. She wasnt on our forest doing her job because of the need for her expertise in the west during one of those wildfires this past year in the west. We need to protect our active management funds. There are some things that came out: a recommendation for larger air tankers to be able to deal with the size and the scale of the wildfires that are out there. We need to. obviously. reduce this litigation. Out of 311 projects this past year. 16 wound up in the courts. That is a significant number. Quite frankly. it is not necessary. Unfortunately. it has become a fundraising scheme for the most part. It is not contributing towards forest health. It. actually. is deteriorating our forest health. We have an increase in invasive species. We are burning up our forest at a record level. When you burn forest. you ruin that water filter. you impact water quality. you impact as a carbon sink. So we need to reduce the litigation and take steps to be able to do that. We do need personnel. there is no doubt about it. We have 49 percent fewer foresters than just in 2010. It is our professional foresters. the silviculturists. who are outof knowing how to mark the timber. of knowing when to harvest the timber when it is at peak value. That is an asset owned by the American people. We shouldnt be waiting until that tree blows over. burns down. or is eaten by some type of bug. invasive specie. until we harvest it. We should harvest it really at its peak value. That is demonstrating a fiduciary responsibility for the American people with this asset. And then certainly we need more collaborative work. Again. H.R. 2647 would achieve that. So that is more efficient. more effective forest management. Let me look briefly at response. We do need to fund this appropriately. I am a supporter of a concept that would look at larger fires. more widespread. I dont know how we gauge thatby acreage or dollar value lost or dollars needed. Those really are natural disasters. They are as every bit a natural disaster as an earthquake. a hurricane. or a tornado. Those larger fires should be dealt with as natural disasters. And then other fires on a smaller scale. underneath whatever that threshold is set. then lets do that through regular order with the Forest Service budget with what we appropriate. There is a definite difference. That would be a recommendation. That was something that came out of a discussion. And then safe harbor for mutual aid. One rancher from Washington talked about a Forest Service where there was aI dont know if it was a State or a private individual with a bulldozera CAT came up to the Forest Service line. Two situations. One time they asked the Forest Service person. who was working under the direction of somebody in the bureaucracy. They welcomed him in. and they saved a tremendous spread of that fire. And then another time where the Forest Service personnel said: No. we have to fill out the permits first. Well. you have got the wildlife burning. but we have got to fill out the permits. and we have got to do the paperwork. I am not judging that Forest Service employee because they were probably doing whatever they were told to do. and there was more catastrophic loss there. So some type of safe harbor that allows better use of mutual aid. I want to yield to a friend of mine because it kind of speaks to the efficiency and the effectiveness on the Equal Access to Justice Act. This is the law that we kind of talked about that really has encouraged radical environmental groups to file lawsuits and stop forest plans from occurring. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia to speak on the topic.,115,115_forest_forests_timber_fires,"['forest', 'forests', 'timber', 'fires', 'trees', 'wildfire', 'fire', 'wildfires', 'thinning', 'logging']",forest - forests - timber - fires - trees - wildfire - fire - wildfires - thinning - logging,0.862003361,TRUE,1140068070

743547,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the City of Atlantic. Iowa for its recognition as a 2015 Tree City USA sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation in cooperation with the National Association of State Foresters and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Services Urban and Community Forestry program (the Forest Service). The City of Atlantic has met the core standards for tree care during the past year. Over 135 million Americans live in Tree USA communities. In its 40th year of celebration. the Tree City USA program is critical to the U.S. Forest Service. This federal partner delivers technical and financial resources to states. cities and communities across the nation with each community adhering to a State Action Plan. guiding investments in each state while accomplishing local projects and programs. The U.S. Forest Service and Arbor Day Foundation cooperate with communities to establish healthy forests. improve air and water quality and contribute to important national energy conservation goals. These local investments create long term major environmental improvements nationwide. I commend the City of Atlantic and urge my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in congratulating the community on this award and wishing them nothing but continued success.,6675,6675_tree_arbor_fresno_trees,"['tree', 'arbor', 'fresno', 'trees', 'usa', 'roofing', 'foresters', 'planting', 'stafford', 'forest']",tree - arbor - fresno - trees - usa - roofing - foresters - planting - stafford - forest,1,TRUE,1140102857

749571,At the heart of the problem is a broken Federal permitting process that has created an unnavigable gauntlet for our hydropower projects. It can now take well over a decade to relicense an existing dam. I will say it again. We are not talking about licensing a new dam. we are talking about relicensing an existing dama process that can take over a decade. For the California consumers of Pacific Gas and Electric. relicensing costs have run as high as $50 million per dam simply to continue an existing project. We are not building anything new. We want to relicense it. It is costing $50 million and taking over 10 years. There was a recent editorial in a Eugene. OR. newspaper. the RegisterGuard. which called for the preservation of hydropower assets. and it noted that the existing Carmon Smith project has been mired in the relicensing process for over 10 years. with a pricetag estimated at $226 million. It amounts to 10 times as much and 3 times as long as it took to build the project when it was constructed in 1963. What is wrong with this picture? Taking 10 times as muchrequiring 10 times as much money-$226 millionand taking 3 times as long to build as when they built that project back in 1963. We are going in the wrong direction. This is not progress. We are headed exactly in the wrong direction. We can change that. Let us put it in the context of what we have existing in this country right now. I said that right now hydro is providing about 6 percent of our energy and about half of our renewables. Onethird of our Nations existing hydropower projects will require license renewals by 2030. Onethird of the existing facilities are going to have to go through this decadelong relicensing process. which will cost millions of dollars. What we need to do is make the relicensing process more efficient by reducing bureaucratic and administrative delays that end up increasing electricity rates. slowing hydropowers expansion. and actually delaying the adoption of environmental mitigation measures. If you are concerned about the environment. you ought to be interested in making sure we have a better process because if we fail to improve the relicensing process. we are going to start losing hydropower projects. and we will backslide as other forms of generation replace them. just as we are seeing with nuclear power in some parts of our country. We are going to go backward. Whether your issue is climate change or whether it is electric reliability or just good. affordable energy. we should be able to agree that this is a situation we want to avoid. We do not want to be going backward on this. Coming from Washington State. Senator CANTWELL understands and clearly appreciates the value of our hydropower resources. I have been very pleased to be able to work with her on many of these initiatives. as well as with many other members of our committee. on some of the bipartisan reforms we have contained within the Energy Policy Modernization Act. What we realize is that our current policies are holding this resource back and that we need to update. we need to modernize them. if we ever want to harness the amazing potential of domestic hydropower. Our joint hydropower language attempts to bring State and Federal agencies to the table with the applicants at the beginning of the process so they can identify where the potential problems may be and coordinate environmental reviews. Because hydropower licenses are issued by the FERC. our bill authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to be the lead agency so they set a schedule and they coordinate all the needed Federal authorizations. The schedule is to be established on a casebycase basis. in consultation with other agencies. and if a resource agency then cannot meet a deadline. the White House Council on Environmental Quality is then tasked with resolving these interagency disputes. In terms of a step that is long overdue. we formally designate hydropower as a renewable resource for the purpose of all Federal programs. When I first came to the Senate some years ago and focused on energy issues. I just really had a hard time with the fact that hydropower was not considered a renewable resource. I was born in Ketchikan. AK. It is in the middle of a rainforest. I was raised in southeastern Alaska. where the annual precipitation is something that would take most peoples breath away. If I were to tell the people of Juneau or Wrangell or Ketchikan that what is coming out of the sky today is not a renewable resource. I would be laughed out of the room. Hopefully we take care of this and formally designate hydropower as a renewable resource for the purposes of all Federal programs. We have very good. commonsense ideas carefully crafted within our bill. Our language does not alter the authority of Federal agencies to impose mandatory environmental conditions or weaken the stringent environmental review process. For those who are afraid that somehow or another we are going to run roughshod over the environmental regulators. that is not the case. What we are doing is. through efficiency. streamlining. and some coordination. we are going to be able to make a difference in our Nations ability to develop hydropower. and that is why the members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee overwhelmingly supported the hydropower provisions in the bill we have before us today. There is always more good news we can add. We have looked at the amendments other Members have offered. We have already accepted an amendment from Senator DAINES to extend the deadline for the relicensing of a hydropower project in Montana. We also have a number of other amendments from other Members from both sides of the aisle. and I am hoping we will be able to add them to the bill. For example. Senator GILLIBRAND has filed an amendment to extend the deadline for a hydroproject in her home State of New York. Senator BURR has filed an amendment to extend the deadline of a hydroproject in his home State of North Carolina. Senator KAINE has filed an amendment to extend the deadline for hydroprojects in his State of Virginia. All of these projects would add power to nonpowered dams. These projects already have licenses. but what they need is more time to deal with the technical and regulatory issues that often arise before construction can begin. We have a fair number of our western Members who are understandably prioritizing hydropower. Senator BARRASSO is filing an amendment to authorize the use of active capacity of the Fontenelle Reservoir in southwest Wyoming. Senators FLAKE and FEINSTEIN have come together with a pretty good amendment to improve the way the Army Corps of Engineers operates dams to increase their efficiency. Is this not just good common sense? It probably comes as no surprise that I have a couple of amendments that will benefit Alaska. including one that will expand the existing project at Terror Lake and allow the local community thereKodiakto remain powered almost entirely by renewable energy. Right now they are 99.7 percent powered by renewable energy between wind and their hydrocapacity. We want them to get to that full 100 percent. Finally. I want to recognize the Senator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. who has a proposal to encourage the development of pumped storage hydropower assetsone of the best ways to store baseload power and a technology that could help to smooth out the intermittency of other renewable resources. We are working on that onechecking it outbut it looks good. These are good proposals. As we continue our voting and clearing process here today. I am confident we will be able to accept many more of them. Again. I want to acknowledge the work and partnership I have with Senator CANTWELL on many of these hydro issues. Her State certainly enjoys the benefit of lower cost energy because of the investments made in hydro. We have more work ahead of us. I know Members are anxious to talk on their amendments that they may have an interest in moving toward this afternoon. but this Senator is glad to be back on the bill. and hopefully we will have an exciting and energetic day. With that. I yield the floor to my ranking member.,2805,2805_hydropower_hydroelectric_dam_hoover,"['hydropower', 'hydroelectric', 'dam', 'hoover', 'ferc', 'dams', 'license', '470', 'deadline', 'enloe']",hydropower - hydroelectric - dam - hoover - ferc - dams - license - 470 - deadline - enloe,0.886924829,TRUE,1140074575

759079,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to introduce my legislation that extends the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project in my district. Specifically. this legislation will provide for a commencement of construction deadline extension for the Enloe Dam Hydroelectric Project that is being developed in Washington State by the Okanogan Public Utility District. in partnership with Energy Northwest. On July 9. 2013. the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) granted the Okanogan Public Utility District an original license for the Enloe Dam Hydroelectric Project. which will be located at the existing Enloe Dam that is situated about 3.5 miles northwest of the City of Oroville in the State of Washington. The current Enloe Dam was constructed in 1920 on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land for power generation. However. operations ceased in 1958 when the extension of Bonneville Power Administrations high voltage transmission line into the Okanogan Valley provided a less expensive source of power. The proposed Enloe Dam Hydroelectric Project makes economic and environmental sense as it will convert currently untapped energy in existing flow releases into clean. renewable electricity. The Enloe Dam Hydroelectric Project will have a footprint that is roughly half the size of the existing facility but will provide approximately three times the generating capacity of the decommissioned plant. Completion of the Project will provide Washingtonians and the Pacific Northwest region with a clean. renewable energy resource that generates an estimated 45.000 megawatt hours per year of carbonfree. renewable power. Additionally. the proposed project will create jobs and needed employment opportunities in a region with an unemployment rate that far exceeds the national average. underscoring the many positive benefits this project will have for the local community. state. and region. The legislation will allow for development of this critical hydropower facility to move forward under a realistic regulatory timeline and in a manner consistent with prior Congressional actions on similar projects. By passing this measure and extending the commencement of construction deadline for the Enloe Dam Hydroelectric Project. Congress can help spur hydropower development in Central Washington and ensure the Projects many benefits are realized. For these reasons I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. which will have a positive and lasting impact on the regions energy supply and economic viability.,2805,2805_hydropower_hydroelectric_dam_hoover,"['hydropower', 'hydroelectric', 'dam', 'hoover', 'ferc', 'dams', 'license', '470', 'deadline', 'enloe']",hydropower - hydroelectric - dam - hoover - ferc - dams - license - 470 - deadline - enloe,1,TRUE,1140101485

763834,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the City of West Des Moines. Iowa for its recognition as a 2015 Tree City USA sponsored by the Arbor Day Foundation in cooperation with the National Association of State Foresters and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Services Urban and Community Forestry program (the Forest Service). The City of West Des Moines has met the core standards for tree care during the past year. Over 135 million Americans live in Tree USA communities. In its 40th year of celebration. the Tree City USA program is critical to the U.S. Forest Service. This federal partner delivers technical and financial resources to states. cities and communities across the nation with each community adhering to a State Action Plan. guiding investments in each state while accomplishing local projects and programs. The U.S. Forest Service and Arbor Day Foundation cooperate with communities to establish healthy forests. improve air and water quality and contribute to important national energy conservation goals. These local investments create long term major environmental improvements nationwide. I commend the City of West Des Moines and urge my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in congratulating the community on this award and in wishing the city nothing but continued success.,6675,6675_tree_arbor_fresno_trees,"['tree', 'arbor', 'fresno', 'trees', 'usa', 'roofing', 'foresters', 'planting', 'stafford', 'forest']",tree - arbor - fresno - trees - usa - roofing - foresters - planting - stafford - forest,1,TRUE,1140104694
