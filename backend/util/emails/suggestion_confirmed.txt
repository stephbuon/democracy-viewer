Dear [[name]],

The suggestion you made to the dataset "[[title]]" has been confirmed by <a href="[[url]]/profile/[[email2]]">[[name2]]</a>, the owner of the dataset.

This suggestion implemented the following change:

Old: "[[old_text]]"

New: "[[new_text]]"

This updated the text in subset search, but visualizations will not be updated unless [[name2]] chooses the reprocess the dataset.
